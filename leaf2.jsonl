While there are many grounds to believe that urban areas provide their citizens with various benefits, it can be equally argued that they also bring about several discomforts to those living there. \\n On the one hand, it is undeniable that settlement in major cities is highly advantageous. The most notable merit is that there is ample job opportunity available in these regions. As metropolitan areas attract a diversity of businesses and industries, their residents are granted career chances in various fields suitable for their ability and ambition. As a result, they are more likely to develop in their chosen profession and achieve success. In addition, in terms of social life, it is apparent that urbanites can enjoy innumerable forms of entertainment and conveniences due to the up-to-date infrastructure as well as advanced technology available in central cities. Hence, they are able to unwind after a hefty day or given a moment away from the hustle and bustle of life. Thanks to those modern urban features, people can accomplish work-life balance and enjoy a fulfilling life. \\n On the other hand, despite all arguments in favor of city life, there is a strong case being made regarding its downsides. First and foremost, while there are various opportunities for job hunting, it seems to be insufficient in comparison to the ever-increasing population of these places. For this reason, competition for a well-paid or favorable position in any career is becoming more challenging than before. As a consequence, many people here are prone to be stuck with a humble, nine-to-five dead-end job because there is little chance for them to get another job soon enough to afford their housing and cost of living. Moreover, the harsh reality of competition in cities hinders residents from taking a break or having some time off despite having been provided with multiple ways of entertainment. Therefore, it is no surprise that life in the metropolis tends to lead to stress and overpressure. \\n By and large, while the advantages of living in cities are beyond doubt, one should also bear in mind the burden that comes along.","human_feedback_text":"The essay is almost 400 words.

By offering an opinion in 2 sections of the essay (prompt paraphrase and concluding paraphrase) the essay creates a partial discussion deviation that negatively affects the overall score. The A \/ D should have been discussed without the writer trying to influence the reader's decision as that was not part of the discussion instruction.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay provides a detailed examination of the benefits and disadvantages of living in cities. You've successfully outlined significant points concerning employment opportunities, social life, competition, and the pressure of city living. However, there are several areas where this essay can be further improved to align it with standard testing requirements and enhance clarity and effectiveness.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** Your essay does address the topic by discussing advantages and disadvantages of city life. However, it's important to closely follow the exact requirements of the essay prompt. For this topic, you were not required to share your personal opinion or lean towards one side. Instead, the task was to impartially present both sides. In future essays, ensure to stick strictly to the prompt's requirements.\n\n2. **Length and Conciseness:** The essay is quite detailed but remember, essay tasks often have time constraints. The length of your essay suggests it might exceed typical time limits for drafting and reviewing within an exam context. Practice writing more concisely to convey your points within a shorter word count. This will help you manage your time better during tests.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Your essay is generally well-written with few noticeable errors in spelling or grammar. However, paying attention to sentence structure and variety can enhance readability. Also, be mindful of using simpler language that conveys your message effectively without complexity, making your essay accessible to all readers.\n\n4. **Clarity of Point of View:** While your perspective comes through in the essay, remember that for this particular prompt, offering a personal viewpoint was not required. Focus on presenting information and analysis that addresses both sides equally without indicating a preference unless specifically asked by the prompt.\n\n5. **Arguments and Support:** You've presented clear arguments for both sides regarding city life. These arguments are generally supported well, though incorporating more specific examples and data could strengthen your case. For instance, including statistics on employment rates or the cost of living in cities could provide more concrete evidence for your claims.\n\nIn summary, your essay demonstrates good analytical skills and understanding of the topic. To improve, consider the purpose and requirements of the essay more rigorously, practice concise writing, maintain neutrality when prompted, and strengthen your arguments with specific evidence. This approach will enhance the effectiveness of your essays in future writing tasks."}

In my opinion, I believe that making community services compulsory should not be exercised in school environment. \\n Firstly, being forced in welfare works could result in more pressure to high schoolers. Community services often requires to pay a great amount of time, hence, when taking part in these activities, students are more likely to lose concentration on school assignments. This means that many young people, especially who are struggling with their study, might find it challenging to keep a good performance in their academic records. For majority of students, particularly who always desire to get a well-paid job in the future, this would not be a viable option. \\n Another point to consider is the lack of efficiencies when high school pupils are forced into such kind of activities. It is obvious that young people also have the right and capability to make decision whether or not to contribute to the society. Therefore, unless high schoolers engage in community works with a proper attitude, they would not be willing to learn and do anything. This would eventually go against the school's expectations, which is helping its students foster a strong sense of community in their minds. \\n In my opinion, instead of making this work mandatory, parents and teachers should encourage and provide their children with opportunities to contribute to the society. By doing this, they can expect these youngsters actually learn from experience of helping others out. \\n To sum up, I believe that making welfare works compulsory is not a perfect way to equip students with the values that parents and teachers expect them to learn.","human_feedback_text":"You misunderstood the prompt requirement. The discussion instruction asks you to respond to the question \"To what extent do you agree or disagree with the given statement?\". The response that you wrote speaks of your \"belief\" regarding compulsory community service. Those are two different responses based on 2 different prompt requirements. Therefore, your prompt paraphrase will result in a failing score for the TA section of your paper, which means the addition of your GRA and C&C problems will result in an overall failing score for your work. Once you make a mistake with the TA representation, there is no way the essay can receive a passing score. Based on this mistake, I will not review the rest of the problems with your essay because this essay has already failed the test. \\n It would have been alright for you to use the term \"believe\" in the response sentence, provided that you had added a measurement of response to it. Some samples of these are ; \"I totally believe that community service should not be compulsory...\" or \" I am of the belief that a total implementation of a compulsory community service...\" When done in the method that still reflects the measured response requirement, your essay comes across as prompt responsive instead of prompt deviant.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay presents a clear stance on the topic of whether unpaid community services should be made compulsory for high school students, arguing against such a mandate. However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the writing.\n\nFirstly, the response to the prompt could be more accurately aligned with the task's requirements. The prompt asks for an evaluation of the extent to which you agree or disagree with mandatory community service. Instead of simply stating a belief, it would be more effective to quantify your level of agreement or disagreement. For example, saying \"I strongly disagree that community service should be compulsory\" would more directly answer the prompt.\n\nRegarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is generally well-written but could benefit from closer attention to detail. For instance, maintaining consistency in tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement would enhance readability and precision. Additionally, avoiding long sentences with multiple clauses can help to clarify arguments and make the essay easier to follow.\n\nThe point of view in the essay is clear, focusing on the disadvantages of mandatory community service. Yet, to strengthen your position, it would be beneficial to use more specific examples and evidence to support your arguments. For instance, illustrating your points with hypothetical scenarios or citing studies could provide a more compelling argument.\n\nThe arguments made against compulsory community service center on its potential negative impacts on students' academic performance and the quality of their engagement in these activities. These points are well noted; however, expanding on these ideas with more detailed examples or statistics could offer a richer, more persuasive discussion. Also, exploring counterarguments before refuting them could further demonstrate an understanding of the issue's complexity.\n\nFinally, the suggestion that voluntary participation guided by parents and teachers could better achieve the desired outcomes of community engagement is valuable. To build upon this, consider discussing how this approach could be implemented and why it would be more effective, thereby providing a more constructive conclusion to the essay.\n\nIn summary, with a more precisely aligned response to the prompt, improved grammatical accuracy, more robust support for arguments, and enhanced clarity and depth in discussing alternatives to compulsory service, the essay could more effectively convey its message and meet the expectations of the task at hand."}

Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. Which point of view do you agree with? \\n Learning a foreign language is becoming a trend worldwide. An increasing number of people suppose that people only learn foreign languages to work abroad and visit a foreign country. Others,however,argue that there are several other reasons explaining for this trend. In my opinion,i strongly agree with the later view. \\n First and foremost,people learn foreign languages to satisfy their interest in linguistics. As we see,many people are passionate about languages. Therefore,they learn foreign languages as a way to pursue their passion. My father's case is a specific example. He has a great enthusiasm about languages and he has been learning four foreign languages. \\n In addition,people learn foreign languages to broaden their knowledge. Learning foreign languages gives them opportunities to expose to different cultures,histories and traditions of other nations. As a result,they will gain useful information. For instance,when learning English,i can get knowledge about many things involving England such as English lifestyles or customs. \\n I admit that many people learn foreign languages with a view to travel or work in foreign countries. However,it is only one reason among lots of reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. \\n In conclusion,i believe that people learn foreign languages not only for traveling and working abroad but also for a lot of other reasons. People should take advantage of languages which they have learned to do other things rather than traveling and working.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, in the opening statement, do not use the term \"later view\" as the correct term is \"latter view\". In order to properly have used this term you should have referred to the first opinion as the \"former\" in the sentence where you say that you agree with the last part of the prompt topic. Aside from agreeing with the latter view, you should have indicated, towards the end of the statement that you will be presenting reasons that will support your claims. That is because the opening statement requires you to outline your discussion procedure, without actually presenting any actual data yet. \\n Now, when you speak of your father as evidence of your opinion, you need to expand upon that discussion by offering the languages that he speaks and most importantly, explain why he had a desire to study these languages. Since that discussion needs to be expanded upon, it should be presented as a separate paragraph within the essay. Since there is a 5 paragraph limit in the essay. It would be best for you to pick your evidences. One pro and one con evidence discussion will suffice in these instances because you only have 3 body paragraphs within which you can discuss these evidences. \\n Based on the content of your essay though. The discussion you provided is acceptable and does the job where you need it to. So I do not think that you will score too low with this essay. I would score this a 5 because of the good way that you developed the discussion. I scored you down for the problem portions in order to come closer to an actual test scoring possibility. \\n Never use stand alone sentences in an academic essay. Always make sure that it falls within the 3 sentence format or incorporate that sentence into the existing current paragraph instead. You have this problem in the sentence preceding the concluding statement and, your concluding statement also suffers from the same problem. That is a writing error that you need to be conscious of and should be prepared to correct once you see that you have committed the error in the actual test.

Instead of saying \"the later view,\" the correct term is \"the latter view,\" which should be paired with \"the former\" to clarify you're talking about the second of two points mentioned earlier. Additionally, at the end of your introduction, outline the main reasons you'll discuss to support your viewpoint. This helps prepare the reader for what's to come without giving away specific details yet.\n\n2. When using personal examples, like the story about your father learning languages, it\u2019s important to dive deeper. Explain not just that he learned languages, but which ones and why. This not only makes your argument stronger but also more engaging for the reader. Given the essay structure, choose your examples wisely\u2014perhaps one supporting and one opposing evidence could be discussed thoroughly within the limited space.\n\n3. Your essay would benefit from adhering to a structured format, especially in how you group your sentences. Avoid standalone sentences. Each idea should be part of a coherent paragraph. For instance, the sentence before your conclusion and the concluding sentence itself should be integrated into fuller paragraphs. This will help with the flow of your essay and ensure it meets academic standards.\n\n4. Speaking of the conclusion, ensure that it summarizes your main points effectively, reinforcing your stance on the topic. Your conclusion could be strengthened by clearly stating that, although travel and work are common motives, the spectrum of reasons for learning new languages is much broader and deeply personal.\n\n5. Paying attention to detail in terms of spelling, grammar, and punctuation can significantly improve the readability and professionalism of your essay. Remember, in academic and formal writing, every small detail counts. For instance, always capitalize the word \"I\" when referring to yourself, and maintain consistency with punctuation, such as using a space after commas.\n\nYour essay clearly conveys your point of view and provides supporting arguments, which is commendable. With these suggested improvements, your essay can become more effective and engaging, providing a stronger case for your perspective on learning foreign languages.

It's apparent you've given thought to the subject, providing examples and drawing distinctions between various professions. However, to further enhance your essay and align it more closely with what is expected in such exams, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Responsiveness to the Topic**: Your essay should closely align with the prompt provided. It's crucial to fully understand the instructions before beginning to write. The prompt requires you to take a clear stance (agree or disagree) on the importance of practical experience versus academic qualifications. Your essay, while informative, seems to present both sides of the argument rather than firmly taking one position.\n\n2. **Structure and Clarity**: The structure of your essay is fundamental. Each paragraph should contribute directly to your argument, supporting the position you've chosen to take. Your segments on the importance of degrees in certain fields and the value of experience in others are insightful but remember to use these points to bolster your specific stance on the prompt.\n\n3. **Language and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, your control of the English language is commendable.

Attention to such details can significantly enhance the readability and professionalism of your essay.\n\n4. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments**: While you present arguments for both sides, it's critical to ensure these points are helping to support your primary stance.

Also, enhancing your essay with specific examples can make your arguments more persuasive.\n\n5. **Point of View**: The clarity of the author's point of view is essential in an argumentative essay. While you mention your perspective, it's somewhat lost in the balanced presentation of both sides. Make your viewpoint unmistakable and use the body of your essay to support it convincingly.\n\nIn the realm of English proficiency tests, understanding and responding precisely to the prompt is just as critical as the content of your essay.

Both external and internal factors contribute to this phenomenon and I take the view that this trend should be changed. \\n There are two main reasons why some courses are dominated by female and others attract male. Firstly, girls and boys are both with difference which is the same as biological level. Courses which are romantic and beautiful are attractive to female students. Nevertheless, male students who are aggressive congenitally just regard these curriculums as tedious as dish washer so scientific classes with practice and analytical thinking are optimum for them. Secondly, it is still prevalent that men are the bread winners while women are caregivers especially in undeveloped regions. Thus the female who plan to major in science and physics may discouraged by conservative gender stereotypes. \\n It will be better if students can choose courses according to their genuine interest instead of optimum from others. We should not impose any restrictions on choices made by students and they should be given more encouragement. Boys who have passion for arts feel free and comfortable when they sit in an art-based class room. Girls should be given equal opportunity as boys to study science. History has proven that women are as good as men in scientific domain as we have witnessed a lot of female Nobel Prize winners in science. \\n In conclusion, the natural difference between men and women and social opinion result in the contrasting subject choices. However, students should learn courses what they love not what are suitable.","human_feedback_text":"Your prompt paraphrase requires a clearer representation of gender. These days, there are more than one gender identities so you have to be specific in your presentation, based upon the original presentation.

Basically, your prompt paraphrase is only partially informative and in accordance with the original representation. \\n Your first reasoning paragraph is not clear at all. Women and men are different on the biological level. Yet you said they are the same. Art subjects do not necessarily mean romantic and beautiful. What do you mean by using the term congenitally? That word, congenitally, does not exist in the English dictionary. That will be a big deduction in your LR score. Do not use phrases that do not make any sense like \"tedious as dish water\".

Perhaps it makes sense in your native tongue, but it does not translate very well to English.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The response to the essay question is relatively clear, centering around the idea that course selection is affected by gender biases, which you argue should change. Your position that students should choose courses based on interest rather than gender stereotypes is a commendable stance. Nevertheless, there are several areas in which the essay can be improved to make your argument more compelling and your writing clearer.\n\n1. **Clarity and Precision in Language**: The introduction of multiple gender identities in recent years requires a more nuanced approach to discussing gender. When referring to gender preferences, it's important to use specific terms (e.g., women and men instead of girls and boys) to enhance understanding. Additionally, be careful when choosing words; for example, \"congenitally\" is used incorrectly. This term refers to conditions present from birth, not innate behaviors or preferences. A correct approach would highlight the need to avoid language and examples that may confuse readers, such as \"tedious as dish water,\" which does not clearly convey your intended meaning.\n\n2. **Supporting Arguments and Examples**: The first reasoning paragraph could use clearer and more logical arguments. Gender differences do exist, but the way they influence course selection isn't as direct or simplistic as described. Subjects cannot be broadly categorized as \"romantic and beautiful\" for females or suited only for males if they involve practice and analytical thinking. This oversimplification undermines the complexity of individual interests and abilities. It's crucial to avoid making sweeping generalizations about what subjects are suitable for whom based on gender. Instead, consider providing evidence or examples to support the claim that societal and cultural norms influence course selection.\n\n3. **Accurate Presentation of Subjects**: The portrayal of subjects according to gender stereotypes (e.g., arts described as \"romantic and beautiful\") could be refined. Subjects should be described by their content and the skills they develop, not by subjective qualities that may not apply universally. This not only provides clarity but also avoids reinforcing stereotypes.\n\n4. **Following the Essay Prompt**: Ensure the essay remains focused on the original topic throughout. While the response effectively argues for the need to move beyond traditional gender roles in education, it could benefit from a more structured approach to directly address the prompt. This includes specifying which subjects are discussed and avoiding vague statements.\n\n5. **Encouragement and Opportunity**: The essay successfully argues that all students, regardless of gender, should have the freedom to pursue their interests. Highlighting the achievements of women in science strengthens this argument. Going forward, aim to balance such positive examples with a critical examination of existing barriers and how they might be dismantled.\n\nBy addressing these points, the essay will likely become more coherent, persuasive, and respectful of the complex nature of gender and education. The goal is to convey ideas clearly and precisely to a broad audience, supporting arguments with logical reasoning and evidence, and carefully choosing language that reflects the diversity and inclusivity of contemporary society."}

Also, advertising plays a significant role in corporate success. I believe that these advertisements encourage people to buy things that they don't actually need. \\n I hold the belief for two major reasons. First, a successful advertising is able to make products become both well-preformed and cost-effective than they really are. Customers who are not interested in the product originally are likely to be attracted by the advertisement and finally decide to by it. For instance, how many times do you believe the medicine on the advertisement is a cure-all? How many times does a hamburger on the menu increase your appetite? However, when the product comes into your hands, you realize that it is not the thing you want. The medicine is not that magical and the hamburger is unsavory. It is reasonable as proper light and beautiful decoration make the food appeals to be more delicious and some products only function well in certain case --- the case shown in the advertisement. Second, in order to earn more profits, encouraging customers to buy thing they don't need is what a company aims to do, and companies achieve the goal mainly by advertising. This point can be illustrated by the example of Bruce Barton, known as Ad Man, have successfully set up one of the major creative advertising firms operating in the United States by selling a mass of products to all kinds of customers, including the one who don't need them. \\n Some may argue that technology revolution has opened up the information highway to everyone. Customers can easily compare products online and make sensible decision. However, advanced technology also enables companies to send more customized advertisement that is in line with buyers' interest, which helps companies to sell more products to those who don't need them. \\n It is safe to conclude that advertising encourage people buy things that they don't need.

You could have used just the first 2 reasoning paragraphs for this essay and closed on a somewhat high score.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay provided offers a clear stance on the impact of advertising, arguing that it encourages people to buy things they don't need. The essay is structured to support this view through examples and reasoning. However, there are opportunities for improvement to make your argument stronger and your writing clearer. Here are specific suggestions:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**:\nThe essay effectively addresses the prompt by stating a clear opinion on the role of advertising in influencing purchasing decisions. To strengthen this, ensure every paragraph directly supports your thesis without deviating from the topic.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**:\nThe essay is mostly clear and free of major spelling or grammar errors. However, attention to detail in terms of grammar and style could further polish the essay. For instance, be cautious with the use of singular and plural forms (\"advertisement\" vs. \"advertisements\") and the consistent use of tense. Simplify and clarify your sentences to make your argument more accessible. Avoid run-on sentences by breaking complex thoughts into simpler, more straightforward sentences.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**:\nYour point of view is evident throughout the essay, which is excellent. To enhance clarity, directly state your main points without relying on rhetorical questions. This approach will make your argument stronger and more direct.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**:\n   - **Directly State Your Reasons**: Jump straight into your argument without declaring the number of reasons you will discuss. Start each paragraph with a strong, interesting topic sentence that introduces the reason you're discussing. This method grabs the reader's attention and demonstrates confidence in your reasoning.\n   - **Paragraph Structure**: Separate your reasons into distinct paragraphs. This clarity ensures that each argument is fully developed and easy to follow. Avoid combining multiple arguments in one paragraph as it can confuse the reader and weaken your essay's impact.\n   - **Relevance and Development of Arguments**: Ensure each paragraph and argument directly ties back to your thesis to maintain a coherent and focused essay. The inclusion of examples is a strong strategy, yet they need to tie back directly to your main point to be effective. The essay occasionally strays into less developed reasoning or examples that don't strongly support the main argument. Concentrate on fully developing a few strong points rather than including underdeveloped ideas.\n   - **Avoid Questions in Your Argument**: While posing questions can engage readers, in this context, it might distract or weaken your argument. Instead, reframe questions as definitive statements that strengthen your position.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\nYour conclusion successfully reiterates the main point. To enhance it, consider summarizing how your examples supported your argument, leading to a more robust closure. By emphasizing your argument's foundation and urging the reader to consider their decisions critically, the conclusion can leave a lasting impact.\n\nRemember, clear and direct language, focused arguments, and structured paragraphs will significantly improve the readability and persuasiveness of your essay.

However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of the argument presented. \n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** It's crucial for essays, especially for proficiency tests, to precisely stick to the prompt's instructions. In this case, the essay attempted to explore both sides of an argument rather than taking a clear stance as instructed by the typical essay prompt. Proficiency tests often require a direct response to a specific question. It would be beneficial to carefully read the question to ensure that the response directly addresses what is asked, such as stating whether you agree or disagree with a given statement, rather than discussing both perspectives and introducing your own viewpoint separately. \n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors throughout the essay that could distract readers and impact the overall clarity of the message. It's essential to proofread the essay to correct these issues. For example, \"hole the belief\" should be \"hold the belief,\" and sentences should end with proper punctuation. Additionally, avoid using ellipses (\"...\") in formal writing as it makes the text seem unfinished or informal. The essay could also benefit from varying sentence structures to enhance readability and keep the reader engaged.\n\n3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** The point of view in the essay is unclear, mainly because it tries to cover both sides of the argument without firmly taking a stand on one. For proficiency tests, clearly stating your viewpoint at the beginning and consistently supporting it throughout the essay is vital. It can help make the argument more persuasive and easier to follow.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** While the essay offers reasons why traveling domestically and internationally can be beneficial, these arguments could be strengthened with more specific examples, and clearer, more concise explanations. Rather than asserting that history lessons are \"bored\" (which should be \"boring\"), explaining how real-life exposure to historical sites can bring history to life in an engaging way could be more effective. Additionally, when discussing the benefits of international travel for language learning and cultural exposure, providing concrete examples or personal anecdotes could make the argument more compelling and relatable.\n\nIn summary, considering the feedback, focusing on clearly addressing the essay prompt, meticulously editing for language accuracy, articulating a definitive stance, and bolstering arguments with specific examples and explanations would significantly improve the essay.

For example, the life can be described vividly through the daily activities filming by the camera, consequently it is easy to understand. In addition, watching a video may not be as time-consuming as reading a book, which is taken into consideration by many folks. \\n However, written documents have many advantages that video records cannot offer. Firstly, they can illustrate the meaning of each activity in depth, which we are not able to comprehend by watching the activity itself. For instance, we can only acknowledge how the Tet, one of Vietnamese festivals, is prepared without knowing the true meanings of each preparation. Secondly, some lifestyles that appeared in the past, when video records were not availabe, can only be learned by the written records. For those reasons, written documents offer us a deep understanding about the lives of people on the Earth. \\n In conclusion, video records may provide an recreational way to learn about the human's life, but written records will be a more-prefered option for those reasons above.","human_feedback_text":"Well, it appears that you are 25 words short of the acceptable word count in this presentation.

This phenomenon can be attributed to the changes in societal values and its consequences on people's emotional well-being might be highly detrimental. \\n To begin with, the increasing desire for self-sufficiency and individualism has contributed to more people opting for solo living. In the past, interdependence and communal living were strongly emphasized, which was evidenced in the large number of multi-generational families. However, this is no longer the case nowadays when contemporary citizens tend to set great store by self-reliance and the freedom to pursue their interests. As a result, they turn to self-contained living as it allows them to gain more control over their lifestyles and living environment. \\n However, I firmly believe the shift towards individual living might go hand in hand with negative impacts on one's mental well-being. This is because solo occupancy is synonymous with less physical interaction with others, resulting in feelings of loneliness and isolation. Such negative emotions, if sustained for a long time, can translate into depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Some may argue that the problem of insufficient physical contact could be effectively tackled by social platforms for they enable people to stay connected with the help of an internet-connected device. Nonetheless, I would contend that such gadgets cannot fully replace in-person interactions since research has shown that physical touch plays an indispensable role in building trust between individuals and promoting overall mental wellness. \\n In conclusion, the rise of solo living in modern society can be explained by the inclination towards personal autonomy and this development might adversely affect one's psychological health. To mitigate these effects, people living alone should be encouraged to participate in community events to cultivate social connectedness, thereby leading fulfilling lives.","human_feedback_text":"The thesis statement for the topic should have been divided into 2 sentences.

Each paragraph should ideally focus on one main idea.\n\n3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: The essay would benefit from a clearer expression of your point of view. The conclusion mentions that television is the most efficient form of communication, but this statement appears to be more of a summary than a clear expression of your personal stance.

I absolutely agree with the statement. \\n For one thing, computers help us communicate with other people from all around the world without the restriction of place. It means that citizens could share and exchange information with people from distinct areas faster and easier. It could effectively minimize the fake news a misunderstanding caused by in-transparented information amongst cities and countries. Moreover, citizens can inspect their governments more successfully, because they could get more reliable news from other countries. It is a helpful way to combat corruption and dictatorship. \\n I could not imagine the world without computers. They construct the modern world we lived in. A huge amount of information in industrial sectors as well as are in the personal lives are stored on serves. In terms of business, computers assist companies by making their staffs more productive. For example, employees could use excel to makes statistics without a huge amount of counting. As regards personal lives, computers also become a vital tool in several sectors, such as the controlling system of railways, banking, electricity, the arithmetic system of shopping carts. \\n Moreover, the excellent counting ability of computers has accelerated the development of sciences massively. They shorten calculation time and calculate unlimited possibilities. Its ability can be used in many fields. For example, computers can calculate the boundary of the universe within minutes, while humans need to use months and years to get the answers. \\n In summary, computers become an essential part of human modern life, thus there is a high chance that world development would severely regress without the advent of computer technology. The invention of computers has not only paved the way for a more equitable world but make people' lives more possible.","human_feedback_text":"You absolutely agree with the statement without giving a thesis statement to support your point of view. That makes your presentation incomplete. There is no standard for your opinion as it is presented. It does not reference the discussion topics that will be presented to expand on your point of view. This is only a 4 paragraph essay. Do not over discuss it. It is not a comparison essay with a personal opinion. It is just a personal opinion statement. So, it is first person pronoun all the way. \\n You are overusing logic in your presentation. Learn to present clear and effective opinions using only 2 solid discussion points. You could have omitted that redundant presentation within the first 2 reasoning paragraphs. You only have to explain once. You do not need to overemphasize your reasoning for the same topic in 2 paragraphs. Each paragraph needs to have a different discussion focus.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay effectively addresses the prompt by strongly agreeing with the statement that computers are the most important invention of the last hundred years. The enthusiasm for the topic is clear, and the essay makes several compelling points about how computers have revolutionized communication, information storage, business efficiency, personal lives, and scientific development. However, to enhance the essay further, consider the following feedback focusing on structure, content, and language.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:** The introduction asserts agreement with the given statement but lacks a clear thesis statement. A thesis statement is essential as it outlines the main points that will be discussed in support of the essay\u2019s position. To improve, try adding a sentence in the introduction that summarily presents the two main reasons you believe computers are the most important invention. This will give your essay a stronger foundation and guide the reader through your arguments.\n\n2. **Focus on Discussion Points:** While the enthusiasm for the topic is evident, the essay tends to repeat similar points, especially regarding the versatility and usefulness of computers in various sectors. Instead, aim for depth rather than breadth by choosing two solid discussion points and explore these in detail. This focused approach will make your arguments more impactful and avoid redundancy.\n\n3. **Paragraph Structure:** Each paragraph should have a unique focus. This essay would benefit from a tighter structure where each main body paragraph explores a distinct advantage of computers, rather than overlapping in topic. By dedicating one paragraph to how computers have transformed communication and another to their role in advancing science, for example, the essay will have a clearer organization.\n\n4. **Personal Pronouns:** The use of first-person pronouns is appropriate given the essay asks for your opinion. However, ensure that the essay maintains an academic tone. Balance personal opinions with evidence or examples that can bolster your claims, making your arguments both personal and persuasive.\n\n5. **Language and Style:** There are some spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., \"serves\" should be \"servers,\" \"transparented\" is not a word, possibly meant \"transparency\"). Carefully proofreading the essay can help to eliminate these errors. Also, simplifying complex sentences can improve clarity. For instance, instead of saying, \"It could effectively minimize the fake news a misunderstanding caused by in-transparented information amongst cities and countries,\" consider \"It can reduce misunderstandings and the spread of fake news through clear, global information sharing.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The conclusion successfully summarizes the essay's main points but could be strengthened by briefly reiterating the value of computers in advancing societal and scientific progress. Highlighting the transformative power of computers in the concluding statement will make for a more memorable closure.\n\nOverall, the essay passionately argues that computers are the most significant invention of the last century. With a clearer structure, focused arguments, and attention to language, it can be even more persuasive and engaging. Remember, quality and depth of analysis over quantity of points can make a substantial difference in the coherence and impact of your essay."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","essay_text":"Nowadays, education plays an important role in people's lives as it can be considered as a major factor that decides the career one might take and the life one might lead. Contributing to the idea, it is said by many people that full-time education is an ideal type for people under 18 years old. This essay will strongly support the opposed concept, which believes students under 18 years old are not supposed to receive full-time education. \\n Firstly, full-time education requires double the time one spends at school, thus will cause them to lack of time to improve other abilities and skills. Consequently, while people gain a great deal of knowledge, they have yet to comprehend general understandings an common sense, which is more necessary to their future career rather than academic knowledge. \\n Additionally, people under 18 years old are still developing not only physically but also mentally. That said, spending much time on a full-time education program in which they barely have an outdoor activities might have negative impacts on their condition in both aspects. As a result, whilst people are still questioning whether the children could inherit the fruits of full-time education, it will be a high chance that they might face several health problems. \\n There is also an argument saying the young should acquire education that takes full time. People supporting this viewpoint believe the larger amount of time a kid spends on studying at school, the better he or she can learn. This might be the outcome of a misleading idea that school is the best place to educate children. In fact, if one spends most of their time learning at school form time to time, they will gradually get bored with the environment and lack the interest in what they learn. Along with the shortage of social skills which only can be gained by hanging out often, staying at school for so long will bring about more troubles. \\n To conclude, it can be seen clearly that there are obvious downfalls of the full-time education if they were applied to students under 18 years old. Therefore, full-time courses might be seen as a bad idea and should never be compulsory for the adolescents. \\n Word counts: 366","human_feedback_text":"The opening paragraph should not present an opinion coming from the writers, as you did, in the topic paragraph.The topic paragraph should come from the original prompt and should not indicate the need for a full discussion (yet).

Here are some areas of strength, as well as suggestions for improvement to make the essay more effective and coherent.\n\n1. **Topic Response**: The essay starts by stating an opinion immediately, which is not typically recommended. It's better to begin with a neutral introduction of the topic as given in the prompt before presenting your opinion. Your essay would benefit from a clear, neutral introduction that sets the stage for your argument.\n\n2. **Content and Organization**: You've chosen to present an opinion that opposes full-time education for individuals under 18, which is a valid point of view. However, the instruction for this type of essay usually calls for discussing your viewpoint fully across at least three body paragraphs. You provided only two main arguments. Adding another paragraph with a strong supporting argument would strengthen your position and adhere to typical essay requirements.\n\n3. **Emotional Engagement**: The essay lacks emotional engagement with the topic. While it's crucial to present logical arguments, incorporating some emotional or personal insights could make your argument more compelling. This can help the reader resonate with your viewpoint.\n\n4. **One-sided Discussion**: Since the essay is meant to present a single point of view, discussing opposing views isn't necessary unless specifically requested by the prompt. Focus solely on supporting your stance. This ensures clarity and consistency in your argumentation.\n\n5. **Grammar and Style**: There are a few grammatical and stylistic issues that need attention. For instance, phrases like \"lack of time to improve other abilities\" could be better expressed as \"lack the time to improve other abilities.\" Also, watch out for word choice and punctuation to enhance readability. Simplifying complex sentences can help avoid these mistakes.\n\n6. **Word Count**: Aim for brevity and clarity rather than meeting a high word count. This essay slightly exceeds the recommended length for ESL learners, which can lead to unnecessary errors and dilute your argument's impact. Focusing on a clear and concise expression of your ideas is more beneficial than stretching your essay to meet a specific word count.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion summarizes your argument against full-time education for those under 18 effectively. To enhance it, consider reemphasizing the key benefits of a more balanced educational approach briefly.\n\nIn revising your essay, focus on these aspects to create a more compelling and coherent argument. Remember, the clarity of your argument and the quality of your writing are more important than the length of your essay."}

Discuss both sides and give your opinion. \\n Education is always considered as an attention- attracting topic. There is a growing concern that educational institutions should spend budget on technological devices for the quality improvement, however, some statements assume that investment should be given to educators. This essay will discuss these two crucial sides and present personal perspective. \\n In the modern society with the advancement of technology, it is undeniable that students should be accessible to computers or laptops to help them accomplish their assignments as well as possible. This should be the indispensable facilities of a school quality standard. School budget needs to be invested in repairing and maintaining them frequently. However, technological facilities could not absolutely contribute to the education quality. \\n On the other hand, teachers significantly contribute to the learning outcomes, particularly to elementary and secondary students. These students need to be guided by not only professional but also dedicated instructors since they are young and may be not able to have awareness of self-study. Therefore, teachers educating them should be sophisticated, overall well-qualified as well. Students need to learn how to be independent of their teachers and that is what a good teacher should do, guiding them in order to boost their attitude towards self-study positively, making their curiosity be aroused, which is vital, since only if the interest in study is inspired, students can find it one of purposes for their attendance at class. \\n From my viewpoint, I coincide with the investment on educators as thoughts expressed and presented above. Moreover, I would like to mention the possible drawbacks of addition of technological devices. In spite of their beneficial function to students' study, they could be described as tempting distraction. For instance, students would use them to excess and uncontrollably, which tends to affect their study to some extent when they completely immerse in video games. Besides, the more equipment would be installed, the more funding would be spent on maintaining and other additional expenses. \\n As has been demonstrated, schools should make funding for both facilities and teaching staffs, both all play important roles in expanding students' knowledge, however, I could say the teachers' quality outweigh the other factor, teachers are always requisite in the academic journey of any student.","human_feedback_text":"The prompt restatement has 2 immediately seen mistakes.

It's clear that there was an attempt to explore both perspectives before stating a personal viewpoint, which is commendable. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of the argument presented.\n\nFirstly, the introduction needs to be more directly related to the specific question. Starting with a general statement about education being an \"attention-attracting topic\" does not strongly tie into the main argument about where investment in education should be directed. A more effective introduction would directly address the debate between funding technology or teachers, setting a clearer stage for the discussion.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction lacks a thesis statement that clearly states your position. For a stronger essay, it's important to summarize your argument and main points in the introduction. This helps readers understand your perspective and what to expect in the following paragraphs.\n\nMoving on to the body paragraphs, while you\u2019ve attempted to cover both sides of the argument, certain points could be further developed for clarity and impact. For example, when discussing the role of teachers, providing more specific examples or evidence could strengthen your argument. Similarly, when addressing the potential drawbacks of technology, including statistics, studies, or real-life examples would make your argument more compelling.\n\nRegarding the essay's structure and style, there are instances of repetitive and complex sentences that could be simplified for clarity.

Though it's beneficial to explore related ideas, maintaining a strong focus on the specific question of investment in technology versus teachers will ensure your essay is cohesive and coherent.\n\nIn summary, focusing on creating a more structured argument, simplifying the language, and directly addressing the essay question with clear support will significantly improve your essay.

This is why obesity has become very rampant. Easily available fast foods is a huge factor as well as our total dependency on technology such that we can do our jobs, communicate with our loved ones and shop online in the comfort of our homes. This also means that there is a minimal amount of physical activities carried out daily. Healthy eating and more exercises will go a long way in curbing this serious issue. \\n Foods that contain abundance of fat are incredibly addictive. Substituting them for healthy meals feel like punishments initially but health enthusiasts say that abs are made in the kitchen, that is, foods consumed make up to 80% of what is needed to lose weight. Weight loss is difficult to achieve but taking it step by step will aid in combating obesity. Making deliberate efforts to take a walk every hour will help sedentary workers stay active all day. For example, the Fitbit app alerts users to take a break to walk 250 steps every hour. \\n Parents can help their children by ensuring that they play outside instead of being on computers, playing video games or watching television all day. Meanwhile, Government should understand that this epidemic is growing out of proportion and thus heavily tax fast food chains and help farmers produce fresh fruits and vegetables. \\n In conclusion, our sedentary lifestyles and readily availability of fast foods have greatly increased the risk of obesity, however, making bold choices to choose healthy foods and increase in physical activities will help to combat being overweight. Additionally, government giving concessions to farmers will help in ensuring that fruits and vegetables are available to all.","human_feedback_text":"The TA score for the first paragraph is always based on the accuracy of your restatement.

However, its structure and content could be enhanced for better clarity and impact. Here are some points for improvement:\n\n1. **Prompt Restatement**: The introduction should accurately reflect the essay's prompt without introducing personal opinions or new ideas not contained in the original statement. Rather than starting with opinions about lifestyle changes and fast food availability, consider restating the prompt more closely to the original, emphasizing the global concern of obesity and suggesting the need for actions by both individuals and government.

To strengthen this, ensure each paragraph consistently supports this view with clear, focused arguments.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: The arguments relating to lifestyle choices and the role of technology, the importance of diet, and government responsibility are relevant. However, they need to be developed more descriptively and systematically. It's important to not just state what actions can be taken but describe how these actions could be implemented and their potential impact.

Each paragraph should focus on a different aspect of how to address obesity, thus avoiding redundancy and ensuring that your discussion is well-developed. \n\n6. **Conclusion**: Avoid adding new ideas or arguments in the conclusion. Instead, it should serve as a summary of the points discussed, reinforcing your stance without introducing new information.

{"source_url":"https:\/\/essayforum.com\/writing\/controversial-topic-governments-invest-94959\/","split":"train","essay_title":"A controversial topic if governments should invest on railways rather than on roads","essay_text":"Nowadays, it is a controversial topic that how governments should invest in people's repair. Many opinions say that the funds should be used on railways while others think that the governments should value roads rather than the other. In my view, I quite agree that the roads should be invested more and this essay will clarify my idea. \\n To begin with, I think there are two main reasons why the governments should invest in the roads. First and foremost, there were not many modern transports in the past so people must move by rudimentary vehicles such as carts and bikes. Besides, these transports can move only on the roads. Therefore, the roads were becoming more and more popular and these days, there are a range of vehicles which move on them. Secondly, the roads help expand the economy and trade between regions easier than the railways. Transports moving on roads can stop and buy anything while the trains moving on railways have separate routines. \\n On the other hand, although the trains are safer and faster, it also brings some drawbacks and inconveniences to use money on the railways. It is easy to witness that the train is a public transport so it brings many problems such as crimes and contagious diseases. For example, the Covid 19 pandemic had been expanded from 2019, the governments encouraged people to use personal vehicles which move on roads instead of the trains. Furthermore, the expenses to build the railways are more expensive than the road. In Vietnam, it takes over 50 billion dollars to build a railway. \\n Generally, the governments will choose the purpose of using money for the roads or the railways depending on benefits which they bring. From my perspective, I strongly believe that the funds should be invested in the roads more than the railways because of the roads' advantages.","human_feedback_text":"The first sentence is unclear in reference.

What he wants to know about is the basis of your opinion in short form, for building upon in the 2 reasoning paragraphs.

Since that is a large percentage of the final score, you must do well in that section if you are to get a good overall passing score.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay discusses an important topic: whether governments should allocate more funds to roads or railways. Here is a comprehensive analysis aimed at improving the essay.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:**\n   The essay addresses the debate on government investment in roads versus railways. It is evident that the author prefers investment in roads. However, the introductory phrase \"people's repair\" is confusing and does not clearly relate to the main topic of infrastructure investment. It would be beneficial to start with a more precise statement that directly introduces the debate on road and railway investment.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**\n   The essay maintains a good level of grammar throughout; however, there are minor issues that require attention. For example, \"Many opinions say\" could be more accurately expressed as \"Many believe\" or \"Some argue.\" Additionally, the use of \"it also brings some drawbacks\" could be streamlined to \"it also has drawbacks\" for clarity and ease of understanding. Avoiding repetition and ensuring subject-verb agreement would also enhance the essay's readability.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Author\u2019s Point of View:**\n   The author\u2019s preference for road investment over railways is clear, which is a strength of the essay. However, the justification for this opinion could be strengthened by refining the thesis statement in the introduction to immediately present the main arguments. This supports the reader's understanding of the essay's direction without ambiguity.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:**\n   The essay presents arguments favoring road investment, such as the adaptability of road transport and its impact on the economy and trade. However, these points could be enhanced with more specific examples and data to solidify the argument. For instance, discussing specific benefits to the economy or citing studies that support the argument could offer stronger evidence. Additionally, the comparison between the costs and disadvantages of railway versus road investment needs clearer elaboration and evidence. Avoiding general statements like \"the expenses to build the railways are more expensive than the road\" and instead providing specific comparisons or data would make the argument more compelling.\n\n5. **Additional Suggestions:**\n   - The argument against railway investment due to public health concerns like contagious diseases could be nuanced by acknowledging modern safety and health measures.\n   - The conclusion briefly restates the preference for road investment but could be improved by summarizing the key arguments presented. This helps reinforce the author's stance and provides a strong closing statement.\n  \nIn summary, focusing on clarity, providing specific examples and data, and refining the grammar will greatly enhance the essay. It is important to directly link the introduction to the topic and ensure that each argument supports the thesis consistently and convincively."}

On my perspective, I suggest we should not focus on any side of them but find a balance between these two important ideas. \\n Traditional thinking can both benefit and limit us in many ways. Orthodox regulations or norms had been formed based on the wisdom of our ancestors in order to prevent unnecessary mistakes for happening again. Sometimes, this wisdom can help we spare time and energy. By contrast, it could be also detrimental if we overemphasize on the power of conventional ideas and be too dependent on them. That is to say, as the world is changing rapidly, we can hardly find any perfect indication which is suitable for every generation. Apparently, following traditions of young people's society is not the best option. \\n However, as encouraging young people to be free to behave as they will is not the truth as well, there are several reasons why I argue this view. Many people suggest that young people should not be limited by the orthodox norms when they are productive and creative. Whereas, I doubt this point of view can make the best of productivity and creativity. Because of without acquiring the lessons which antecedents had learned from the past, the youngs are more likely to undergo the same mistakes again, which is an unreasonable behaviour. Also, I do not think that anyone is allowed to forget or ignore the truth of who they are and where they come from. \\n To sum up, while traditions of our society and the creativity and productivity of young people are both vital elements of education, I disagree we should focus more on any side, instead, we should dedicate ourselves to balance these two ideas.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, the essay asks you to discuss 2 points of view aside from your own.

Your essay primarily focuses on your perspective without adequately discussing the other two viewpoints separately.

A strong conclusion restates the importance of the debate and clearly shows where you stand after considering the different viewpoints.\n\n5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**\n   While your essay includes some minor grammatical errors, focusing on sentence structure and verb tense will increase its readability. For example, phrases like \"help we spare time\" should be corrected to \"help us save time.\" Paying attention to these details will enhance the professionalism and clarity of your writing.\n\n6. **Personal Opinion as Body Paragraph:**\n   Remember, your personal opinion should emerge after examining both perspectives, not as an additional body paragraph but as part of your conclusion. It should reflect a balanced analysis, informed by the discussion of the preceding viewpoints.\n\nIn summary, your essay brings valuable insights to this discussion, but structuring it to explicitly address each viewpoint separately and providing a clearer introduction and conclusion will make your argument more persuasive and easier for the reader to follow. Simplifying language and correcting grammatical errors will further enhance the quality of your work."}

However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the clarity, relevance, and impact of the essay.\n\n1. **Essay Topic Relevance**: The essay's content needs to align more closely with the assigned task of writing about a one-day excursion. Consider revising the focus to emphasize the exploratory and excursion aspects of the day. This could involve highlighting how the event was a unique opportunity to discover new interests or places, or how it differed from a regular day, thus aligning more closely with the concept of an excursion.\n\n2. **Title Correction**: The title needs revising to accurately reflect the content of the essay. If the essay is meant to describe a flash mob, ensure that the term is correctly used both in the title and the essay itself. If the event was not a flash mob, then consider a title that better captures the essence of the described activities and experiences.\n\n3. **Date Specification**: Including the year alongside the date of the event provides essential context. This helps the reader understand the timing of the event in relation to current events or trends, making the narrative more engaging and informative.\n\n4. **Description of Activities**: Expand on the description of activities to clearly state whether the event was a spontaneous gathering (flash mob) or structured sporting activities. If the latter, accurately describing the sequence of activities and how they contribute to team building, health, or enjoyment would enrich the narrative. Specific examples of interactions or personal achievements during the event could add depth to the essay.\n\n5. **Grammatical and Stylistic Corrections**:\n   - The phrase \"all the students took together in the gym\" can be revised for clarity. Perhaps, \"all the students gathered in the gym\" would convey the intended meaning more accurately.\n   - \"After getting tired we went on lunch\" could be corrected to \"After getting tired, we went to lunch,\" to improve flow and correctness.\n   - In the comments section, \"Everyone was enjoyed\" could be revised to \"Everyone enjoyed themselves,\" for grammatical accuracy.\n   - Ensure consistent tense usage throughout the essay to maintain clarity and coherence.\n\n6. **Clarification and Expansion**:\n   - The perspective of the essay appears to be from a participant who found value in both the communal and physical aspects of the event. To strengthen this viewpoint, consider adding reflections on personal growth or observations about team dynamics.\n   - More detailed examples of how the event was both fun and beneficial could solidify the author's viewpoint. Describing specific interactions, feelings, or outcomes from participating in various activities would make the argument more compelling.\n\nRemember, a good essay not only tells but also shows. Use vivid descriptions, precise language, and clear structure to take your reader on a journey that not only informs but also entertains and enlightens.

While I agree that private firms could carry out this research, I also believe that the states should assume responsibility for conducting them. \\n On the one hand, there are several reasons why private companies should be enabled to execute scientific research. The first reason is that this could help to reduce pressure in the state budget. As a result, citizens have to pay lower taxes, and authority would have more cash to spend on different fields such as infrastructure or economic development. Another reason is that scientific research which is managed by private firms usually complete quickly and efficiently. Because of profit motivation, companies tend to hasten the investigated process by spending more money and engaging much competent staff for projects. For example, a company called Tesla had carried out massive research in order to produce electric cars and introduce them to the market in 2014. \\n On the other hand, it is wrong to reject the argument in favour of the control of authorities on scientific research. Government- decision making is the best way to prioritize expenditure on essential areas of research which can be helpful for society in the present and future.

Going straight in gives off the sense that it is the only benefit you are going to list.) The proponents of this trend are convinced that there are a number of benefits that come with it. Firstly, computers provide students with unlimited sources of information. Google is an excellent illustration for this advantage. With a touch of a button, For instance, by using Google or other search engines learners are able to tap into a wide range of online materials that might be inaccessible without technology. Another benefit of utilising the screens in learning process lies with the ability to take online courses and study at one's own pace.

The negatives, therefore, come nowhere near matching with the positives that technology has brought about. \\n To encapsulate, while it is important to acknowledge certain negative impacts of using technology in education, the benefits are enormous and should not be ignored.

Some think that this may impact adversely to the local communities; however, I think that despite having a negative impact of burgeoning business of supermarkets, mom-and-pop stores are deemed to survive. Here are my analysis on this. \\n Although supermarkets are back by corporate giants with best in class business acumen, a lot of time they fail to understand the local household needs. Local businessmen have acquired the knowledge while evolving their society and passing the baton through generations. This has led to building of a tacit understanding between the residents and community shop owners rendering to create an emotional connection and relationship between them. Another reason that will help these businesses survive is their proximity to the house. Supermarkets are huge in size and require large area where it can be built. This impedes them to exist near to a lot of household. Smaller shops will be in a better position when one needs to buy few items under time constraint. \\n Advocates of the supermarkets on the other hand argues that the freebies and discount offers given by the supermarkets are going to attract a lot of businesses. With the support of investing behemoths, they will keep offering the discounts for a longer period of time gradually killing the smaller players. \\n To each their own.

Artist often reflect society's culture, heritage and traditions in their artistic works and projects. Hence, It will pass the legacy of a society to their coming generations. In addition art also educate us about our ancestors thoughts and mental approach.

Nowadays, almost everyone is involved in artistic work or buys art. For instance, peoples tend to buy movie tickets, paintings, sculpture, novels and etcetera, these all are great examples of art and source of entertainment from children to elderly people.

{"source_url":"https:\/\/essayforum.com\/writing\/zoos-cruel-closed-down-90488\/","split":"train","essay_title":"Zoos are cruel and should be closed down","essay_text":"Wildlife conservation is of great importance and zoos are one of the possible solutions to protect wild animals species from the threat of extinction. Some critics argue that the existence of zoos is not necessary because it is cruel to capture the living creatures in conservation areas. On the contrary, some strongly advocate zoos due to their contributions to the preservation of wildlife. In my opinion, I am reclined towards the latter notion and will clarify both points of view in this essay. \\n It can be seen in zoos that many species are being mistreated. Due to the difficulties in adopting a totally new living environment, hundreds of endangered species are forced or even tortured to eat strange food. Then comes the death and even extinction of those animals. For example, Ba Be turtle, a threatened and endangered animal species in Vietnam, is inhibited their reproductive capacities, resulting in facing the brink of extinction. Therefore, governments should introduce legislation to restrict or ban zoos from being open to the public. \\n To some extent, zoos can be useful in the process of animal preservation. First, the ecological diversity can be maintained in the areas keeping abundant categories of wild animal genes. Apparently, this is regarded as a contributing factor in reinstating biodiversity. It can be justified that primates such as apes or monkeys are prone to poaching and slaughter. So, zoos can relatively protect them from such anthropogenic harmful activities. In addition, governments can easily raise people's awareness by facilitating tourists to visit the animal conservation areas. In other words, the sense of wildlife conservation can be promoted to the public and at the same time, attracting anyone to contribute to the campaign of saving endangered animal species prior to their extinction. Annually, educational institutions, for instance, can organize wildlife trips for students to have deeper understandings of wildlife and its implications on our lives. \\n In conclusion, threatened and endangered animals should be protected in zoos, though there are some mistreatments as a few exceptions. I, personally, opine that zoos are helpful in keeping wildlife diverse and will be a backbone in promoting wild animal protection if governments grant permission to be open to the public.

Let's discuss how to enhance this piece, focusing on adherence to topic, spelling, grammar, stylistic issues, clarity of the author's stance, and the supportiveness of the arguments.\n\n1. **Adherence to Topic:** The essay addresses the main topic, exploring the significance of wildlife conservation and the potential role of zoos. However, it's essential to structure the essay to reflect the discussion points more clearly. The essay should clearly present two public opinions and follow with a personal viewpoint. This structure wasn't entirely evident, creating some confusion about different perspectives.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** A notable issue is the incorrect use of \"reclined\" instead of \"inclined,\" which distorts the intended meaning. It is crucial to ensure word usage is precise to convey the correct message.

This method not only aligns closer with the essay prompt but also enriches your discussion, making your stance and reasoning clearer to the reader.\n\nIn summary, focusing on precise word choice, clear and structured argument presentation, and closer adherence to the requested discussion format will significantly improve the quality and efficacy of the essay.

While I understand the logic behind this suggestion, I still firmly disagree with it for several reasons. \\n Those who believe that payment is the main motivation for working may have several arguments. They may well argue that it is the element which is important to one's needs. From my perspective, it is undeniable that money plays a vital role in every aspect of life, from daily expenses to long-term financial goals, such as homeownership, education and retirement planning. Without a good salary, individuals may have trouble making ends meet, especially when the cost of living has been rising more and more. Another possible argument is that financial incentives are compelling factors to employees, which could enhance job satisfaction and alleviate financial stress. Such tangible rewards not only recognize an employee's value but also provide them with a sense of stability. \\n Nevertheless, I still oppose this view for some reasons. Chief among these is that job satisfaction can extend beyond monetary rewards. Factors such as a positive work environment, opportunities for personal growth, work-life balance, and especially passion for the job are considerably more influential. These contribute to an ideal workplace that fosters a sense of belonging and job satisfaction, making employees more likely to stay. Another point worth mentioning is the relationships that individuals build within the company can also be a potent motivator that keeps one to continue devoting to the same firm. Employees may choose to remain with that company because of the friendships they have formed or people for whom they have an affection. \\n In conclusion, it is understandable that payment is an essential element regarding one's motivation to stay working for the same company. However, I cannot support such a view since many other reasons keep individuals motivated, including job satisfaction and good workplace.","human_feedback_text":"You have an under developed essay presentation.

The structure of the argument presents an imbalance, where initial paragraphs focus on acknowledging contrary arguments that suggest money is a central motivator.

Avoid spending too much time on viewpoints that contradict your stance unless specifically tasked to explore both sides equally.\n\nIn terms of arguments supporting the author's position, the essay successfully identifies job satisfaction, a positive work environment, personal growth, and workplace relationships as critical factors surpassing monetary motivation. Nevertheless, these arguments would benefit greatly from more detailed examples and an in-depth exploration. Explicitly connecting these factors to how they foster employee loyalty more effectively than monetary incentives would offer a clearer, more compelling case.\n\nTo conclude, focusing more on reinforcing your main argument and less on acknowledging counterarguments, unless specifically asked to present a balanced discussion, will make your essay more focused and persuasive. Clarifying and expanding upon the reasons behind your stance with concrete examples and explanations will significantly enhance the depth and persuasion of your essay.

Rather than beginning with a proverb, which might obscure your main point, directly stating how globalization affects these aspects could strengthen your introduction. For future essays, make sure your opening statement directly addresses the topic and include specific elements from the prompt in your argument.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors that need attention.

Reinforce your opinion with strong, supportive reasons that underscore the validity of your perspective.\n\n4. **Arguments Supporting the Author\u2019s Position**: Your essay presents arguments for both the positive and negative impacts of globalization but ensure that your supporting points are directly relevant to your stance. In future essays, each paragraph should clearly contribute to reinforcing your main point. Use examples and explanations that directly relate to the disadvantages you see in globalization, and avoid discussing the positive aspects if they don't serve to ultimately support your main argument.\n\nFor improvements, consider structuring your essay to introduce your main opinion, followed by paragraphs that each offer a distinct reason supporting your view, using clear examples and explanations.

However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay attempts to address the given topic by examining both sides of the argument concerning animal experimentation. However, the introduction lacks a clear thesis statement that outlines the approach to be taken. It's essential to clearly state the intention in the introduction, for example: \"In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives on animal testing and offer my viewpoint.\"\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Your essay exhibits numerous grammatical and stylistic issues that hinder understanding. To bolster your score in the grammar, accuracy, and range (GRA) section, it's crucial to refine your sentence structure and grammar. Make use of simpler sentences where necessary to convey your points more effectively. Misuses of words and awkward phrases confuse readers. For example, \"We have no choice except to use animals\" could be better expressed as, \"We are often left with no choice but to use animals for testing\". Paying attention to proper grammar and sentence structure will make your arguments more persuasive.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** Your position on the topic becomes evident towards the end of the essay, yet it seems somewhat muddled throughout the discussion. To make your viewpoint clearer, directly state your opinion early in the essay, and consistently reinforce it by examining each argument through that lens.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** Your attempt to cover too many points in a single paragraph dilutes the strength of your arguments. Focusing on one argument per paragraph allows for a more in-depth exploration and clearer line of reasoning. For instance, when discussing the ethical implications of animal testing, dedicate an entire paragraph to that issue alone, providing clear examples or evidence to strengthen your argument.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion of the essay should succinctly summarize the discussed arguments without introducing new information or opinions. Rather than closing with your personal stance, recap the key points made in favor of and against animal testing, then briefly restate your own viewpoint if necessary. This approach maintains the coherence of the essay and reinforces your arguments to the reader.\n\n6. **Overall Coherence and Cohesion (C&C):** To improve in this area, consider organizing your essay with clear, logical paragraphing. Each paragraph should have a single focus, introduced by a topic sentence, followed by supporting sentences that flesh out the argument. This structure not only aids readability but also strengthens the cohesion of your essay.\n\nIn revising your essay, focusing on these aspects will greatly enhance its clarity, persuasiveness, and overall quality. Taking the time to plan your essay, ensuring each paragraph has a clear purpose, and rigorously proofreading for language errors will contribute significantly to a stronger presentation of your arguments."}

I totally disagree with this idea. \\n It is easily to see that meat is an important part of people's diet. Meat has a huge number of essential nutrients for human and some of that are not replaced or it is very expensive if people want to make them. For example, vitamin named B12 is only found in animals. Vegetarians usually have problem with the health about their brains because they do not have enough that kind of vitamin. They cannot remember well or feel tired frequently. There is a mecina which provide vitamin B12 but using in the long term, people might get some side effects. \\n People who have heart disease, kidney or blood problems are usually afraid of eating meat. However, doctors advice them to reduce the amount of meat but not to cut out of that. Patiens could choose to eat some food like salmon, pork and so on. Those are not only delicious but also helped to improve their health. Furthermore, meat is a kind of food which is very cheap and popular. With the developments of agriculture industry, the cost of meat is lower but the quality is higher for example chickens, pigs, fish. \\n In conclusion, although a vegetarian diet maybe good for people who have problem about cholesterol, heart attach but I believe that meat still is an important food in people's diet.","human_feedback_text":"If you notice, in the original discussion, there is no argument being presented.

To enhance this essay and make it more effective, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Clarity and Response to the Topic**: The essay's introduction misinterprets the prompt by presenting it as an argument rather than a topic for discussion. Focus on clearly stating your position in response to the topic without labeling it as an argument. This helps in staying true to the prompt and maintaining accuracy in your essay.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: The essay contains several spelling and grammatical errors that affect its overall clarity and professionalism. For example, \"mecina\", which seems to refer to \"medicine\", is incorrect and not in English. Pay attention to correct spelling and use of English vocabulary. Avoid using words from other languages unless appropriately contextualized. Additionally, phrases like \"It is easily to see\" should be corrected to \"It is easy to see\" for grammatical accuracy. Review your essay for incorrect vocabulary usage and aim to use words correctly to enhance your essay's clarity.\n\n3. **Clear Point of View**: Your stance is clear from the beginning as you express total disagreement with the idea of becoming vegetarian. However, avoid exaggerations or absolute statements unless you can fully support them. Expressing your point of view in a measured manner can make your argument stronger.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay does present arguments in support of including meat in the diet, citing nutrition and health benefits. However, the arguments sometimes lack depth and specific examples. For instance, while Vitamin B12 is correctly identified as an essential nutrient found primarily in animal products, the discussion around its importance and the implications for vegetarians could be expanded with more concrete evidence or studies. Similarly, when asserting the economic benefits of meat consumption due to developments in the agriculture industry, providing data or sources could strengthen this claim. \n\nFinally, aim for a balanced view by acknowledging the merits of opposing opinions without undermining your own stance. This not only shows a comprehensive understanding of the topic but also enhances the persuasiveness of your argument. By focusing on these aspects, the essay can significantly improve in both form and substance."}

Though they may make extraordinary contributions, the demographic transition has a severe impact on society. \\n To begin with, it's necessary to clarify what the aging trend actually means. First, it involves larger older population, who, admittedly, are special assets to society for their experience, knowledge, sophistication and growing eagerness to continue working. More Often than not they are the backbone of their fields, as proved by Nobel-winners. The leading figures in science are all at an advanced age. \\n However, the steady increase in senior citizens also drives up healthcare costs, since the elderly are vulnerable to disease and sometimes suffer from more than one condition at a time. According to the WHO, the over-60s already account for a quarter of the global burden of death and illness. Financial pressure is exerted on sociality. More resources have to be allocated to them and then the share of others is squeezed. \\n The situation is even worse, given the fact that the higher proportion of the old also involves, though not obviously, lower birth rates and the consequent smaller younger population. In this respect, social institutions for children and adolescents bear the most direct effects. In Japan, for instance, over 400 schools are forced to shut down per year from 2003 onwards. \\n Labor markets are not spared either, since youths are the major source of workforce. It is certain to shrink when the numbers of younger people reduce. The elderly cannot compensate for the shortage. In general, they are less energetic and ambitious and their physical conditions don't allow them to work as blue collars. Smaller labor force leads to fewer taxpayers. The financial pressure from older people becomes all the more unaffordable. \\n The conclusion is clear: the comparative increase in older people adds to financial burden and weakens labor force. It causes comprehensive, far-reaching, and above all, mainly negative effects on society.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, an IELTS Task 2 essay is limited to only 5 paragraphs composed of a maximum of 5 fully developed sentences.

That is because your outlining, drafting, revising, and finalizing of the essay needs to be completed within the 30 minute time allotment. So practice writing using a timer set to 30 minutes at a time. It is pivotal that you practice in an actual exam setting in order to be better prepared for the actual test day. \\n Based on the aforementioned instructions, you should be able to tell for yourself which among your paragraphs fail the task accuracy and grammar accuracy scoring portion of the test.

Practicing writing with a timer set to 30 minutes can help in adapting to these constraints.\n\n2. **Clarity in Introduction**: The opening statement of the essay needs refinement to directly represent the author's point of view more clearly. It's crucial to clarify whether the perspective presented is a personal belief or a general observation right from the start. This will help prepare the reader for the argument and reasoning that follow.\n\n3. **Use of Examples**: While the essay uses examples to support its arguments, it's essential to rely on practical examples that derive from personal knowledge or experience. Avoid exaggerations or references to specifics like \"Nobel Prize winners\" or quoting research, as this is not practical in a test setting where external resources are inaccessible. Using relatable and straightforward examples can also improve sentence structure and make the essay more compelling.\n\n4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. Consistent review and correction of these can significantly enhance the readability and professionalism of the essay. Paying attention to punctuation, verb tense consistency, and avoiding run-on sentences will be beneficial.\n\n5. **Balanced Argumentation**: While the essay effectively supports its main point, considering the inclusion of counterarguments or acknowledging potential benefits of an aging population could provide a more balanced perspective. This not only showcases critical thinking but also demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nBy addressing these points, the essay can be improved to better meet the criteria of English proficiency tests and present a well-rounded, coherent argument.

While your essay makes a strong case for state-funded elder care, there are several areas that could be improved for better clarity and effectiveness. Here are specific points to consider:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** Without the complete prompt, it's challenging to assess if your essay fully addresses the intended topic. Ensure your essay directly responds to the specific question or statement provided in the prompt. Avoid repeating the question from the prompt in your essay. Instead, convert questions into direct statements to present your argument more assertively.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Your essay has some spelling and grammatical errors that make it difficult to understand in places. For example, \"appers\" should be \"appears,\" \"especial\" should be \"special,\" and \"subsidy\" should be used as \"subsidize.\" Also, consider using connecting phrases to improve the flow of your essay. Phrases like \"In addition to\" should complete the thought, such as \"In addition to these concerns, the problem appears because it opens a polemic discussion.\"\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your viewpoint is clear -- you believe the state should be responsible for elder care due to the taxes society pays. This is a strong position, but ensure that every paragraph reinforces this stance without ambiguity. For clearer presentation, avoid using first-person expressions (\"I strongly think\") and instead present your arguments objectively.\n\n4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** Your essay makes a general argument for state responsibility in elder care but lacks specific examples or detailed reasoning that could make your case stronger. Include evidence or data (e.g., how tax money is used in different sectors and the benefits of state-funded elder care) to support your position. Each paragraph should contain one clear idea, supported by facts or reasoned arguments.\n\n5. **Paragraph Structure:** Aim for a consistent structure in your paragraphs, including an opening sentence, body sentences that provide support, and a concluding sentence. Each paragraph should ideally consist of 3-5 sentences to provide enough depth without overwhelming the reader.\n\n6. **Rephrasing Necessary:** Transform any posed questions into statements to make your arguments stronger. For instance, instead of asking \"Who have to pay for the care of these people?\" say \"The responsibility for elder care should fall to the state, not individual families.\"\n\nRemember, an effective essay is not only about presenting your viewpoint but doing so in a clear, coherent, and persuasive manner.

In order to do that, humans have created a society where everything is optional and one can choose whatever they want in life. However, too much of a good thing can be a bad thing, with some saying that in today's lives we have an abundance of choices. I completely agree with that statement. \\n The reason for this phenomenon is rather straightforward, as explained above. Humans strive to make everything simpler for them, thus they created things that aided them in everyday lives. This explains why technology has never been more advanced than ever before. The advancement later on led to the embarrassment of riches that we are currently suffering. Humans now have more food, entertainment services, occupations,..to choose from. \\n At first glance, having multiple options seems like a good thing, but research has shown that when humans are presented with an abundance of choices they tend to be subjected to a syndrome called analysis paralysis, which means one gets paralyzed or stumbled when they have to draw a good decision from the presenting choices. For example, one goes to a supermarket to buy a particular object, a bag for instance. When they get there, they see that the supermarket sells multiple types of bags. Since that person just needs to buy a bag, with no specific preference, they are forced to pick from this array of options. Struggling to make a decision, they become paralyzed and unable to choose. This situation occurs not only in daily life activities but in social settings, relationships, and more. \\n Examples for having too many choices in life are evident. People are experiencing them everyday. Like in dating, we once only had few options but now with social media we know more people and that means more people to choose from. Or watching tv, we once only could watch what was on tv due to cable scheduling but now with streaming services we can watch anything at any time. With buying products, we have websites to increase our options, with entertainment, we have the internet to cater our every need. Our choices are increasing day by day due to the improvement in life. \\n All in all, compared to the restricted life of the past, today's lives offer humans a more satisfying life, because people have more to choose from. Everything has become more convenient. However, humans are not equipped with a mind set that can analyze multiple choices, this creates problems when they are presented with numerous choices. And like the saying, too much of a good thing can be bad.","human_feedback_text":"Some task questions tend to sound like research prompts, but they are not.

Keep it simple and easy to read. Save the academic research discussion for when writing actual course related papers already. The discussion must focus on simple reasons that support the writer's opinion instead.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay on the topic \"TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING CAN BE BAD\" presents a clear standpoint that an abundance of choices in today's society, although seemingly advantageous, can lead to negative consequences such as decision paralysis. The argument that the array of options available today can be overwhelming is well-communicated. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to better meet the expectations for English proficiency tests.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay successfully addresses the topic, presenting a clear viewpoint that aligns with the statement that having too many options can be detrimental. However, the length of the essay exceeds what is typically required or expected for such assignments. English proficiency test essays usually require concise responses within 250-300 words. It's important to express your ideas succinctly and to stay within the word limit, focusing on quality over quantity.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor grammatical errors and instances of awkward phraseology that could be refined for clarity and fluency. For instance, \"the embarrassment of riches that we are currently suffering\" could be more clearly expressed as \"the overwhelming abundance of choices we currently face\". Paying attention to grammar, sentence structure, and word choice will enhance the readability of the essay.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: The essay's point of view is clear; the author agrees that an excess of options can be negative. To strengthen this perspective, try to incorporate personal insights or common examples that readers can easily relate to, rather than relying on scientific research or terminology, which may not be accessible or appropriate in the context of an English proficiency test.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: While the essay provides examples to support the claim, such as the difficulties in choosing a bag or selecting a dating partner, it would benefit from focusing on simpler, more relatable reasons that directly support the writer's opinion. Avoid the inclusion of research or scientific terms, as the main objective is to convey your personal viewpoint and reasoning in an understandable manner. Remember, the aim is to share your insights and observations rather than to compile scientific evidence.\n\nIn summary, the essay would gain from being more concise, simplifying the language and examples used, and ensuring that the arguments directly and simply support the author's point of view. Striving for clear and grammatical writing, while adhering to the word limit and focusing on personal insight, will significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay."}

They thought the birds have bred with another member, such as the red northern birds which is lives in the West, but then they figured out that the red birds are thousands of miles away from these eastern North America woodpeckers. \\n According to new research published in The Auk, the observation has given a result that 'you are what you eat' has proven unexpected true. The answer why it turns out to be red, because of its diet. The birds is eating red berries which can turn their feathers having a dark deep red color. The changing color into yellow, orange, or red hues is common in bird's feathers which actually come from the food they eat that produce some pigments.","human_feedback_text":"Andika, this is an acceptable summary at this point. I believe that you could have created an almost perfect summary if you had omitted the first sentence in this summary statement. Sticking to the opening from the point where you speak of the Orinthologists would have immediately called the attention of the reader to the information offered within the original article. The first sentence, which was meant to act as the hook did not work very well because there was no proper set up for the statement sentence. Before that topic sentence was placed, you should have placed a simple narrative sentence that would have implied that people were wondering about why the bird's feathers were changing color in the first place. A general observation of sorts would have sufficed prior to the presentation of the information that people could not figure out why that was happening. By the way, next time, kindly post a link to the original article for our reference during the review of your essay. Thanks.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"This essay addresses an interesting topic about how the diet of North America woodpeckers affects the color of their feathers. It\u2019s evident that the essay is in response to the topic, and there is a clear point of view presented, which is that the diet of these birds is responsible for the change in their feather color.\n\nTo improve, starting the essay with a more direct approach about the ornithologists\u2019 observations rather than the rhetorical question in the first sentence could make the introduction stronger and more engaging for readers. The initial sentence does not effectively set up the essay's focus and can be confusing. Instead, beginning with the factual observations made by ornithologists about the feather color change could immediately capture the reader's attention and set a clearer context for the following information.\n\nThere are some spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that need attention. For example, \u201cthere were some ornithologists have noticed\u201d should be corrected to \u201csome ornithologists have noticed.\u201d Likewise, \u201cthe birds is eating red berries\u201d should be \u201cthe birds are eating red berries\u201d to match the plural subject with the verb. Paying attention to subject-verb agreement and sentence structure will make your essay more accurate and easier to read.\n\nRegarding the clarity and descriptiveness of the arguments, the essay does provide a straightforward explanation linking the birds\u2019 diet to the color of their feathers. To strengthen this argument, including more details or examples of specific types of red berries that cause this change, or mentioning any scientific explanation provided in the research, could add more depth to your essay and make your argument more convincing.\n\nFinally, it would be helpful for readers if references to the source material, like the research published in The Auk, were more detailed. Providing a brief overview of the research process or findings could offer more background and support for your statements. Although you may not always be able to link directly to sources in your essays, mentioning the study's authors or the specific issue of the journal could enhance your credibility and allow readers interested in further information to find the source material easily.\n\nBy refining the introduction, addressing grammatical issues, and adding more detail and context to support your arguments, you can enhance the overall clarity and persuasiveness of your essay."}

As it has both merits and demerits, I will try to support both views with supporting ideas. \\n Starting with the benefits, the mentioned belief can be a reason for mental strength in childrens' minds. When they get an assurance of success after investing their best, they learn to deal with failures positively. For instance, A.P.J Abul Kalam was born in a poor family. He could not think of being a president for the surroundings he has. Believing that hard work does pay off, he could fulfill his dream. Instead, if a kid is always impulsed by telling that trying enough does not work, he might lose interest in life, and this can lead to depression. \\n However, strong belief, sometimes, tends to make some students desperate, ultimately leading to the regret of wasting their time in the wrong work. By way of illustration, if one has an inborn talent for music, it is not wise for him to try heart and soul for becoming the best businessman throughout his life, for his surroundings say so. Rather, he is able to be a way better musician with the same effort. Kids should be disadvantaged if they are not told to recognize their own areas of interest and talent before trying hard enough. \\n To conclude, telling \"the hard work\" as the only way to succeed can lead a child to invest his time in the wrong work. On the other hand, telling it should help the child to be stronger.","human_feedback_text":"You are still using the original reference words in your restatement. There must not be any trace of the original keywords and prompts in your newly developed paragraph. Using synonyms, you should have changed most words and phrases from the original such as: \\n - in some cultures ( cut and paste from the original) \\n When using local heroes for your examples, always remember to indicate who he is. What were his accomplishments? What made him admirable? Remember that the examiner will not be familiar with these people in most instances so the relevance of this reference point as an advantage would not be clear to the examiner. You only explained his surroundings, but you did not explain the cultural relevance of this point. How did culture play a role in his success? Who told him he can succeed if he tries hard enough? The most important discussion aspect is the cultural reference and it was lost in your discussion.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay provides an interesting exploration of the merits and demerits of encouraging children to believe that hard work can lead to success. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance the clarity, relevance, and effectiveness of your argument. Let's address these points systematically:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay somewhat addresses the given topic by discussing the positive and negative aspects of instilling the value of hard work in children. To strengthen your response, consider rephrasing common phrases and avoiding repetition of words or ideas directly from the topic or prompt. Employing synonyms and restructured sentences could make your argument more original and engaging.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few areas that need attention:\n   - The term \"childrens'\" should be corrected to \"children's\" to denote possession correctly.\n   - Be mindful of sentence structure and punctuation. For instance, consider breaking long sentences into shorter, clearer ones for better readability. Additionally, watch for the correct usage of commas and periods to avoid run-on sentences.\n   - Use transitions smoothly between your points to lead the reader through your argument cohesively.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your essay presents a balanced view by considering both sides of the argument. To make your position or perspective clearer, perhaps conclude with a stronger, more decisive statement that reflects your overall stance on the issue. This will help the reader understand your personal perspective more clearly.\n\n4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: Your use of an example involving A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is promising, but it lacks sufficient context and details for readers unfamiliar with him or his cultural significance. It is essential to include brief backgrounds of examples or individuals mentioned, explaining their relevance and accomplishments. This not only strengthens your argument but also ensures your essay is accessible to an international audience.\n   \n   Additionally, when discussing the idea that not everyone should pursue the same path (e.g., the musician vs. businessman example), clarify and expand on this point. Discussing how personal interests and natural talents should guide one's efforts rather than societal or cultural pressures alone would reinforce your argument.\n\nIn summary, to improve your essay focus on:\n- Revising for grammatical accuracy and clarity.\n- Using a wider range of vocabulary to avoid direct repetition from the prompt.\n- Providing more context and detail for examples used to support your argument.\n- Clearly stating your own perspective, particularly in the conclusion, to leave the reader with a definitive understanding of your stance.\n\nBy addressing these suggestions, you can make your essay more persuasive, engaging, and clear to the reader. Remember, the effectiveness of an essay is not only in presenting arguments but also in how convincingly and coherently you communicate those arguments."}

It is certain that being a host of a worldwide sports event is beneficial to the countries. In my opinion, the advantages of hosting such events will outweigh the drawbacks. \\n First, hosting international sports functions help to promote the host countries. With the spread of social media such as Instagram and Facebook, more people around the world will start to discover the countries. A positive image may be built by google the fun facts or history of the destinations. For example, there are numerous posts discussing the cuisines and attractions in Tokyo during the Olympics. \\n Second, organizing the global sports functions can increase the economic activities of those countries. Usually, people tend to watch the games offline and they will book the flight tickets to come and visit. For instance, many tourists came to China during the Beijing Olympics because they wanted to support their favorite athletes. Therefore, they booked accommodations and restaurants for their vacation. More profits can be generated from these activities. \\n Although some people believed that hosting international events will damage the living quality of the locals, it is a treasurable opportunity for the locals and foreigners to have a cultural exchange. They may have the chance to get to know different cultures and languages and may make new friends through chatting with people who have various cultural backgrounds. \\n To sum up, organizing worldwide sports events will bring a huge number of benefits to the host countries in the long term even if there are disadvantages in short term.","human_feedback_text":"The prompt restatement+opinion is totally incorrect. You failed to restate both public opinions in individual sentences, then offer your opinion based on the given points of view. The alteration of the discussion from a compare + contrast + supporting personal opinion to an advantage v. disadvantage essay will result in a failing TA score because you are not discussing the essay as per the prompt expectations. This early error could very well be the reason that your essay gets a failing score in the end. \\n Having reviewed the rest of your writing at this point, it is safe for me to say that the essay will not get a passing score as the task discussion requirement has not been met by your presentation.

You need to write prompt responsive essays if you hope to pass this test.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay shows a good effort in discussing the benefits and potential negative impacts of hosting global sports events. However, there are several areas where it could be significantly improved to meet the expectations of English proficiency tests.\n\n1. **Addressing the Topic Adequately**:\n   - The essay attempts to outline the advantages of hosting international sports events but doesn't directly address the comparison and contrast of public opinions before expressing a personal viewpoint. It's crucial to fully understand and respond to the essay prompt. To improve, focus on clearly stating different perspectives as presented in the prompt before introducing your opinion. This structured approach is essential for a successful essay.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**:\n   - The essay is generally understandable but contains some grammatical errors and awkward phrases (\"the awareness towards holding global sports events of people has been rising\"). To make your writing clearer, consider revising sentences for better structure and clarity. Tools like grammar checkers or additional reading can aid in recognizing and correcting these errors. Aim for simplicity and accuracy in your expression.\n\n3. **Clarity of Author\u2019s Point of View**:\n   - While your stance on the issue is clear \u2014 that the benefits of hosting outweigh the disadvantages \u2014 it\u2019s buried under the listed advantages. For an enhanced argumentative essay, present your thesis statement more prominently in the introduction and reiterate it in the conclusion for emphasis.\n\n4. **Arguments and Descriptions**:\n   - The essay provides examples to support the benefits of hosting global sports events, which is good. However, the arguments could be strengthened by incorporating more detailed analyses and including a wider array of perspectives, especially those that challenge your view. This will create a more balanced and persuasive essay. Also, considering the cultural exchange part, make sure to show how disadvantages are effectively outweighed by these exchanges, providing a clearer link between your points.\n\n**To Improve**:\n- **Focus on essay format and prompt adherence:** Understanding and practicing the expected essay format is crucial. Spend time familiarizing with different types of prompts and how to structure your responses accordingly.\n- **Grammar and clarity:** Pay closer attention to grammar and sentence structure. Practicing writing and seeking feedback will be beneficial.\n- **Balanced Arguments:** Enhance your essay by presenting a balanced view before stating your opinion convincingly. Use examples and evidence more effectively to support your argument.\n\nRemember, the purpose of feedback is to guide you toward improving your writing skills.

In my opinion, both parents and teachers have an important part in raising good children. \\n On the one hand, it is undeniable that father and mother are the primary mentors of children. From birth to preschool, children are usually under sole cusdoty of their parents. A lot of recent studies have shown that a child learns family values unconsciously by observing his or her parents' actions. If parents behave well, children will behave well and the opposite is also true. In addition, when children are taught a concept of good by their parents, they are unlikely to go astray when growing up. Therefore, parents should be obligated to develop their children's behaviors. \\n On the other hand, school is where children spend more of their time in later stages. When in school, they have to follow the rules and the regulations set by the school in order to lead a disciplined life both inside and outside the school vicinity. School brings students not only academic knowledge but also life lessons which make them well-rounded individuals. It is beneficial for them to learn how to co-operate with their peers and teachers and cope with situations, which would lead to their considerable contributions to the community in the future. \\n In conclusion, I think either parents or educators are responsible for improving young people's characteristics to be valuable members of society. Although their roles are different, they are complementary to each other in educating children to be the most desirable characters of the social system.","human_feedback_text":"The instruction for this essay is to discuss both public points of view, based on commonly used reasons, and then present your point of view based on the public discussion.

So the presentation becomes incomplete and only partially correct in the discussion approach. The essay will only be partially scored due to the lack of clarity with regards to the points of view discussion.

Yet, it's important to integrate a personal viewpoint more clearly within the discussion portions of the essay. Instead of waiting until the conclusion to reveal your stance, weave your perspective throughout the essay to make your position more prominent and engage the reader in ongoing analysis.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay is generally well-written but watch out for minor errors and typos; for instance, \"cusdoty\" should be \"custody\".

Occupations that focus on creative expressions(artists, poets and musicians) are not as important as occupation that emphasize analytical expression(lawyers, doctors, engineers) is a controversial one. Some believe that one should choose a career which will allow one to creatively express themselves. While others believe that an occupation where one applies logical reasoning followed with good monetary returns is the best. After a careful thought, I some what disagree with the statement because as children, we were told that whatever you do in life, you should be content and do it with full enthusiasm. We should follow our dreams and respect each and every work as no job is small or insubstantial. \\n Who decides which occupation is the best? Which career guarantees complete success? Which career is the most satisfying? Everyone has different answers depending upon how they perceive their jobs. A person who is satisfied with his job and is motivated to grow in that particular field has chosen the best career path for himself even if it involves creativity or logical reasoning. Today, there are various career options where one gets to express themselves creatively. They get to express their ideas and emotions through a variety of mediums like paintings, dance and music. With the increase in technology, their creativity is spreading like fire and they are being appreciated for their work and also doing financially very well. \\n It is my belief that one should choose a career based on their interest and passion. My classmate Ria in high school was a trained dancer and had won many competitions in school. In our last year, we had a career orientation fair where we had to choose a particular field. Most of us had chosen commerce or science because we were naive as everyone told us that career ins science or commerce would be the best for us. Ria was the only who selected Arts as she wanted to become a dancer. Soon we all became busy in pursuing our respective careers. After 7 years, I accidentally bumped into Ria at the Mall and she told me that she was a choreographer with Digital Films production house. She also shared her experiences of performing live and how she organized TV and stage shows. She was doing very well for herself as she soon was starting her own dance academy. \\n Some people are born talented with multiple intelligences. If motivated and given the right advice and support, they grow up to be successful in the career they chose for themselves. With their extra ordinary qualities they can also achieve great success in those fields. If Eminem was asked to be an engineer and Sundar Pichai to be a singer, I am sure they would not be that successful as they are in their respective fields. Lot of examples of musicians and artist are there like Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Shakira, Lata Mangeskar and many famous artists which can be taken into account to prove that they are doing equally good or better than people of other occupations.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, I apologize for what I am about to say because I found that this sort of essay writing for the CBEST cannot score higher than a 2 because of a number of reasons. I believe that once you learn to avoid the mistakes I will be enumerating, that you will be able to improve your scoring consideration for this test. \\n The first problem with your essay is that you do not follow through on the discussion as provided by the prompt. You took almost a whole paragraph where you presented a series of questions that caused you to not discuss the essay in the manner expected by the instructions you were given. Rather than doing a comparative response immediately after saying that you \"some what\" agree with the essay, you went on to respond to the questions that you posed instead. Causing a prompt deviation which caused the essay to lose focus in terms of the original discussion. \\n The reasoning that you are using in the 2nd paragraph is weak and pretty much generalized in presentation. This was caused by the focus on the previous questions that you posed in the paragraph. Instead of questions, you should be presenting evidence to support your claim. The supporting evidence needs to be something popularly known on an international basis or, you could base this on your personal knowledge instead. \\n In your opening statement, you also use the term \"controversial\" to describe the topic you were provided for the discussion. If you review the essay, there is no such controversy being referred to. So while the ideas are properly presented, implying something about the original prompt that is not justified nor supported by the original presentation means that your response is weak and confusing. \\n The reasoning is also not very effective because, while you chose to use evidence based on someone you know, your next set of evidence uses someone that is not well known to those outside of your country. It is always best to stick to popular examples or, even better, use personal experience in this area. \\n The mistakes in your sentence structure and word usage tends to become distracting which creates choppy sentences. Mistakes such as \"some what\" when the correct term is \"somewhat creates a confusing sentence because of the way the terms are used. \\n Remember that you are supposed to be presenting this academic paper to peers who happen to be teachers as well. So when you make mistakes like these, your ability as a potential educator comes into question and, with such a low score, means you are not capable of fulfilling the tasks you will be required to do. \\n The closing paragraph feels rushed and ill informed. You said that there are people who are born talented with multiple intelligences. Yet the examples you use are of people who are known for just one thing. Therefore, your presentation becomes ineffective and unclear. When you say something that important, you need to follow it up with examples of multi talented people and a description of what these multiple talents are. \\n Don't forget the importance of the closing paragraph. Without a properly summarized discussion, your essay becomes open ended and doesn't come across as truly effective and informative because it does not offer the reader a chance to decide for himself based upon your concluding statement.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay addresses an intriguing topic that prompts a comparison between careers emphasizing creativity and those focusing on analytical skills. However, there are several aspects that could be improved to better align with essay writing criteria and enhance overall clarity and impact.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay somewhat deviates from directly addressing the topic by posing a series of questions early on. It's important to remain focused on your main argument and provide a clear stance. You indicated partial disagreement with the statement but quickly moved away from comparative discussion. Refocusing your essay to directly contrast the importance of creative vs. analytical professions with supportive arguments would strengthen your response.\n\n2. **Evidence and Examples:** Rather than relying on rhetorical questions to advance your argument, incorporate concrete examples or personal experiences that clearly support your position. While the anecdote about Ria, a successful dancer, is a step in the right direction, adding universally recognized examples or more personal insights could have provided stronger support for your argument.\n\n3. **Clarity and Structure:** Several phrases and terms are used unclearly or incorrectly, such as \"some what\" instead of \"somewhat\". Additionally, the mix of very specific and more general examples without clear distinction or explanation can be confusing. Simplifying sentence structures and choosing words more carefully will make your writing more accessible and understandable.\n\n4. **Grammatical and Stylistic Issues:** Pay attention to grammatical errors and stylistic issues, as these can interrupt the flow and make your essay less coherent. Avoid using choppy sentences and try to ensure that your essay flows smoothly from one point to the next.\n\n5. **Point of View and Argumentation:** Your point of view is present, but the arguments sometimes lack depth and specificity. The essay would benefit from a clearer and stronger articulation of your perspective, ensuring that each paragraph contributes to your overall stance.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The concluding paragraph should succinctly summarize your main points and reinforce your position. It's an opportunity to leave a lasting impression on the reader. You touched on the importance of pursuing one's passions, but be cautious about making broad generalizations. Focus on tying back to the key arguments discussed and offering a thoughtful closure that reflects on the essay's opening statements.\n\n7. **Controversy and Critical Discussion:** While you've described the topic as controversial, the essay doesn't fully explore the differing viewpoints in a balanced manner. It would be beneficial to more critically engage with the topic by examining and contrasting various perspectives before reinforcing your conclusion.\n\nImproving in these areas will significantly enhance the quality of your essay, making your arguments more compelling and your writing clearer. Remember, successful essays are not just about what you say but also how you say it. Keep practicing, and consider these points as opportunities for growth in your writing skills."}

This is because they have a tendency to think that every single people has the same proportion to develop their skill. \\n To sum up, it is not right to exclude males and females in certain work field because there are more advantages to allow both genders to have the freedom of their job preference. if people want to reach their goals they must work hard since big effort is the crucial aspect to be a successful person, not gender.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, let's start with the grammatical problems in your essay. You have made a grammatical error regarding word usage in the following sentence: \\n as men <b>an<\/b> women have different <b>ability<\/b> \\n - you were making a comparison of two genders therefore it is not \"an\" but \"and\". In addition, \"ability\" is singular but since you are discussing two genders, the plural form \"abilities\" should be used. \\n - I would like argue \\n - would like TO argue \\n - There should be a change in the plain verb form \\n There are also clarity problems in the essay which relate to your word choice usage. Since those problems are only presentational in effect, I have opted not to point those out in the essay. The word usage does not change the meaning of the sentence or paragraph anyway. \\n Your prompt paraphrase is confusing in presentation and does not accurately depict a retelling of the original discussion and its direct response requirements. This should have been written as: \\n <em>Males and females are often seen as having a specific skillset that one excels in over the other. That is why some professions, such as those that rely on physical strength and dexterity, tend to exclude either the man or woman from the performance of work tasks. In my opinion, excluding either gender based on a gender abilities cannot be considered right.<\/em> \\n You need to be careful when you write words and make sure to review your essay before submitting. A \"Tome\" is a a book, especially a large, heavy, scholarly one. While \"To me\" is a direct reference to the writer.

It is not possible to complete internet based research during the actual test since this a pen and paper exam. There will not be any reference materials available and even if there were, 40 minutes to complete the writing will prevent you from doing research.

However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, grammar, and overall effectiveness.\n\n1. **Grammar and Spelling Corrections:**\n   - In the sentence \"as men an women have different ability,\" it should be corrected to \"as men and women have different abilities\" to correctly link the subjects and use the plural form of \"ability.\"\n   - The phrase \"I would like argue\" is missing \"to\" and should be corrected to \"I would like to argue.\"\n\n2. **Clarity and Word Choice:**\n   - The essay contains some confusing sentences that could be simplified for clarity. For example, the introduction could more directly state the opinion by saying, \"Gender should not determine job roles, as both males and females have equal capabilities.\"\n   - The word \"Tome\" seems to be used incorrectly. It appears you meant \"To me,\" which would correct the sentence to convey your personal perspective.\n   - Avoid assuming the availability of research or specific data during a test, as this might not be practical or allowed. Focus on personal insight and universally understood arguments.\n\n3. **Structure and Style:**\n   - The essay sometimes struggles with run-on sentences. Shorter, more concise sentences can improve readability and ensure your arguments are clearly understood.\n   - Consider organizing the essay into clearer paragraphs with specific focus areas, such as one paragraph on economic benefits, another on societal progress, etc.\n\n4. **Supporting Arguments:**\n   - While you mention significant points about gender equality and its benefits, providing more specific, relatable examples or hypothetical situations could strengthen your arguments. Remember, during an exam, relying on general knowledge and logical reasoning is more practical than citing specific studies or data.\n   - Ensure every argument directly supports your main point of view. Clear connections between your opinion and the evidence you provide strengthen your essay.\n\n5. **Perspective and Point of View:**\n   - Your point of view is generally clear, advocating for gender equality in the workplace. Consistently using the first person in statements like \"In my opinion\" or \"I believe\" can further emphasize your personal stance on the issue.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, your essay can become more coherent, persuasive, and grammatically correct.

From my perspective, this trend is unfavorable due to the following three reasons. Firstly, the tendency to stay single increases the rate of people suffering from psychological problems. There is a high likelihood that the unmarried have to cope with numerous strains of study, work, and finance by themselves. They do not have intimate enough relationships to confide in, which leads them to have more adverse attitudes. A recent study discloses that single people often resort to drugs to relieve stress and many become addicted. Secondly, the single lifestyle results in population aging. People living alone tend to spend all their time enjoying their own life instead of having a baby, which is considered a key contributor to the decline in fertility rates. Lastly, this trend inhibits long-term economic growth. Some people might say that single life boosts economic growth because individuals can completely concentrate on careers. However, these might be merely short-term benefits because of predictions about a dramatic increase in the proportion of older people, which will put heavy pressure on health systems and welfare. Moreover, a decline in the working-age population is unavoidable, so the economy may be in a deep recession due to the scarcity of the labor force. In conclusion, the unmarried lifestyle is detrimental due to problems of psychology, the aging population, and the economy.","human_feedback_text":"This is a good example of a failing score task 2 essay. The minimum word count of 250 words was not met, indicating a high deduction rate for an under discussed essay.

Though the response is correct, the student did not present a discussion outline to build the discussion points. \\n Though proper reasoning was provided, the lack of logical paragraph based explanations per reason was not shown. A lack of proper response development led the essay to a failing coherence and cohesiveness score.

No effort was placed in the development of the essay.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay effectively responds to the topic of living alone, offering a clear stance on why this trend may be considered negative. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance the quality and effectiveness of your essay, based on the requirements for English proficiency tests.\n\n1. **Topic Response and Development**: It appears that the original prompt may have had a broader or different context that was not addressed directly in your essay. If the original topic mentioned \"In many countries,\" it's important to incorporate this international perspective into your response. This shift from a possibly wider issue to a more localized view can affect the relevance of your argument. Additionally, your essay would benefit greatly from expanding on each point with more detailed explanations. Each of your main reasons should ideally be explored in separate paragraphs, including examples or further details to support your arguments. This development is critical for meeting the minimum word count requirement, which is fundamental in avoiding penalties for under-discussion.\n\n2. **Structural Coherence**: Your essay has a good basic structure, but it lacks the detailed development necessary for high scores on coherence and cohesion. Introduction of your main points at the beginning, before diving into each reason in its own paragraph, can significantly improve the flow and clarity of your argument. Including individually developed paragraphs for each main point will not only aid in meeting the word count but also in making your essay more coherent and easier to follow.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: While your essay is generally well-written, paying close attention to grammar and style can further enhance its readability and professionalism. Ensuring variety in sentence structure and precise word choice can also contribute to a more compelling and nuanced argument. \n\n4. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your stance on why the trend of living alone is unfavorable is clearly stated and maintained throughout the essay. However, the expression of this viewpoint can be strengthened by providing more specific examples, statistics, or studies to back up each of your points. This evidence will make your position more persuasive and grounded.\n\n5. **Supportive Arguments**: You've outlined three main reasons why living alone can be seen as negative, but the depth of your arguments is somewhat limited. Delving deeper into each reason, with evidence or examples, will not only make your essay more informative but also more engaging. For instance, referencing specific studies or statistics regarding the psychological impacts of living alone can add credibility to your arguments.\n\nIn summary, focusing on expanding your discussion to meet the word count, including specific examples or evidence to support your points, and structuring your essay to enhance coherence and cohesion, are key areas for improvement. This will not only address the task more effectively but also make your argument more convincing and your essay more aligned with the expectations for English proficiency tests."}

It's crucial to stick closely to the original prompt and avoid introducing unrelated information. Make sure every point discussed is clearly linked to the question being asked. \n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay contains some spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues.

This clarity will help strengthen the argument and ensure the discussion is coherent.\n\n5. **Structure and Development**: There is room for improvement in how ideas are organized and developed. Each paragraph should contain one main idea that is expanded upon in a clear and concise manner.

It is sometimes argued that people lose their identity by using similar products promoted in the advertisement. From my point of view, I completely disagree with this statement. \\n Thanks to advertising, both large and small companies have the opportunity to enable customers to know their products. People are exposed to kinds of products with different styles and patterns produced by the companies. At the same time of providing more choices for the consumers, advertisements also create the demands in the market to a large extent. By using products merchandised by diverse companies, people are distinguished by their clothing and accessories. On the surface, the one wearing a pair of Vans looks entirely different from another one wearing boots produced by UGG. \\n In addition, individual character comes more from the educational background and thoughts than wearing. The knowledge imparted in schools cultivates students' tough and tolerant personalities so that those who are well-educated tend to look more energetic and courteous than those wearing similar but ignorant and narrow. What's worse, when seeing the same advertisement of a fancy handbag, an ambitious university student may be inspired to earn money to afford it in the future while another youth who drops out of school in the childhood may commit a crime by robbing others of the bag. This is because people react differently to the same advertisement depending on their consciousness. \\n In conclusion, I do not agree that advertising is making people similar to each other.

Parents used to buy toys for children as a reward if they got good grade or as a present in some specific holidays, like the Christmas. I think having toys is important for children, but having too many toys would be a problem. In this essay, I intend to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this issue. \\n [Advantages] \\n Having different kind of toys is helpful for children's intelligence development since they have to good at some skills to play the toys well, for example, puzzle games require a great logic ability. Computer games of specific type, like real-time strategy games require highly concentration and strategy planning ability to win the game. Since parents provide many different kind of toys for their children, it is inevitable that they would have plenty of toys. \\n [Disadvantages] \\n Though having many different kinds of toys or games definitely provide some advantages, however, there also some disadvantages for having too much toys. The most worst case is that parents intend to let toys to replace their role if they don't have enough time to accompany with their children, so buying toys becomes a kind of compensation behavior for these parents. In fact, this behavior is not really helpful for improving the relationship with their children, they still need to spend some time to interact with their children in daily life. Besides, many toys are often discarded by children when they grow up, since they don't play them anymore. Many of these abandoned toys are made by plastic, and they certainly threaten our environment when they become garbage. \\n [End] \\n By way of conclusion, I think parent's attitude about toys is the key factor of whether they will give too many toys to their children.

Next time, clearly indicate whether you believe the situation is positive or negative in the introduction and reiterate this standpoint in your conclusion for greater clarity.\n\n4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** You've given clear examples to support the points made, such as the benefit of flexibility and the challenge of maintaining discipline at home. This is a strength in your essay. Enhancing this further by providing more specific examples or personal anecdotes could make your arguments even more compelling and persuasive. Also, when discussing disadvantages, offering potential solutions can show critical thinking skills.\n\nIn summary, your essay successfully explores the nuances of home-based work and study, which demonstrates your ability to engage with complex topics. To improve, focus on directly responding to the essay prompt, clarity in expressing your viewpoint, and enhancing the coherence and depth of your arguments. Keep practicing, and with each essay, your writing will grow stronger and more effective."}

This essay disagrees with this opinion because not all students can afford to pay the costs and university can be of benefit to society as well as the students. \\n To begin with, university's tuition fees in general are costly in most of the countries all over the world, particularly in countries which have high-quality education such as the UK, the USA and Australia. It is estimated that the tuition fee per year in European countries is 12,000 dollars, which is a big deal of money for many students, especially those from less developed areas and nations. If they are not supported with scholarships or financial aids, they will not stand a chance to enter those universities regardless of their high potential, which is a waste of intellectual resources. \\n Secondly, it is undeniable that university can be advantageous to society. High-performing students after graduating from universities and colleges can serve the community in different fields, namely lawyers, doctors, teachers. For instance, many smart students from Asian countries nowadays have a chance to study in prestigious universities and colleges in the UK and later become qualified workers to contribute to the wellfare of citizens in their own countries. \\n In conclusion, it should not be obligatory for students to be responsible for all the tertiary tuition fees since if this is the case, many cannot afford to go to universities despite their high academic performance and society altogether can benefit greatly from third-level education.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, your paraphrase is inaccurate and does not properly reflect the sentiment of the original prompt. there is no argument presented, only a discussion. Exaggerating this portion on your part was meant to call attention to your English vocabulary. Unfortunately, that created a misrepresentation of the prompt in the process. You must always stick with the academic tone of writing in these essays and never exaggerate the discussion topic presented as that would indicate a lack of English understanding on your part. The more accurate tone of paraphrase for this prompt would have been: \\n <em>A discussion has been presented regarding who has the responsibility for the payment of university educational fees. An idea has been brought forth that the student must pay for all of the college related fees because the rewards of a completed undergraduate education benefits the individual more than his community. In this essay I will be discussing the reasons why I do not agree with this point of view.<\/em> \\n Note the level tone of presentation in my opening paraphrase. It merely restates the prompt in a manner that highlights my knowledge of the English vocabulary, without changing the tone of the original prompt. It is not sensationalist, nor exaggerated. It is merely informing the reader of the previous information that I was provided for the discussion, in an academic tone. That is what you should strive to achieve in all of your prompt paraphrases. \\n Your line of reasoning \/ discussion is severely flawed in this instance. You are automatically assuming that all college students are not financially capable of paying for their fees. Hence the need for scholarships. You failed to consider the other side of the discussion that relates to those students whose parents can afford to shoulder their educational needs. Should they also be given scholarships? What if their grades do not qualify them as exemplary students? Should they still be given a free education? \\n When you write your supporting statements, always make sure to think of the other side of the argument and defend against it. That is why you were given 3 body paragraphs to defend your stance in. In this instance, you should have thought of these aforementioned counter arguments before you wrote what became a severely weak defense of your stance on the issue. \\n Do not write run-on sentences for your conclusion. Always try to present the essay in a complete paragraph form otherwise you will lose points in terms of GRA and C&C considerations. In this instance, your otherwise strong conclusion was marred by the improper sentence formatting. This will result in a reduced overall score for your essay.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay successfully addresses the topic regarding who should bear the responsibility for university tuition fees. It argues against the viewpoint that students solely benefit and thus should cover all expenses, highlighting financial accessibility issues and societal benefits of educated individuals. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance the essay's clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness.\n\nFirstly, the introduction could more accurately paraphrase the original prompt without changing its tone. An academic tone is crucial in essays. Instead of asserting a position that strongly diverges from the prompt, aim for a balanced and precise restatement that sets the stage for discussion. This approach demonstrates a solid grasp of the language and topic.\n\nSecondly, the reasoning presented tends to generalize the financial capabilities of all students. It's important to acknowledge the diversity of students' economic backgrounds and consider counterarguments to present a more robust discussion. For example, exploring how students from wealthier families fit into this debate or discussing merit-based versus need-based financial aid could strengthen the argument.\n\nAdditionally, while the essay provides some examples of how university education benefits society, it would benefit from more specific and varied arguments to support this point. Demonstrating how different fields contribute to societal well-being can make a more compelling case for why society should invest in higher education.\n\nStylistically, there are occasional grammar and punctuation errors that slightly hinder readability. Careful proofreading and shorter sentences could help in making the essay more accessible and polished. Remember to avoid run-on sentences, particularly in the conclusion. Ensuring each paragraph and sentence flows logically and clearly will improve the overall coherence and readability of the essay.\n\nLastly, conclusions are crucial for restating the main points and reiterating the importance of the topic. It's important that conclusions are presented in complete and well-structured paragraphs. This not only reinforces the arguments made but also leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the essay's stance.\n\nIn summary, while the essay presents a relevant discussion, refining the paraphrase of the prompt, addressing counterarguments, avoiding generalizations, improving grammatical accuracy, and ensuring a coherent structure will significantly enhance its effectiveness and persuasiveness."}

From a positive perspective it could be said that instead of thinking of it as a hardship think of it as an opportunity. Of course when one is in the middle of a problem they might not be able to think this but there always is something good about it. \\n To prove this my example will be the new crisis that came upon the world 'COVID-19'. Everyone is stressed upon the fact that they might die or lose their family and friends. Nobody goes outside anymore. Everyone stays home from fear and anxiety. People say things like ' what good can this virus bring' or ' how can we look at the positive side at such a time' and I might agree with them but I won't because I realized that there are opportunities even in this crisis. \\n For example, the fact that the children didn't talk to their parents, uninterested in family affairs and were total freeloaders got the opportunity of becoming closer to their parents. Another example would be the decreasing of environmental pollution; animals came out of their homes, the sky and sea are much more clear and the ozone layer is healing. People would say that the ozone layer would never heal but now it is healing. \\n It's hard to believe in this statement but the harder we think the faster we will realize that it is true.","human_feedback_text":"What I immediately noticed with your essay is the creative title that you gave it. Never lose that gift. It is the title that will first catch the reader's eye and, if found to be interesting enough, will be the most useful hook that the essay can give the reader. Excellent word choice. It is simple, but effective. Try to kick up your English vocabulary a notch. Aim for intermediate word usage so you can grow you simplistic vocabulary to a step above. \\n You have to learn when to use commas to help create a more readable sentence. A comma is often used: \\n -After an introductory element (So, To prove this) \\n - When writing a series of connected words as a successive list (Oxford comma) \\n Properly placed in sentence usage, it can be effectively used to create effective pauses in a sentence: \\n - <em>For example, the fact that the children didn't talk to their parents, uninterested in family affairs<span class=\"r\">,<\/span> and were total freeloaders<span class=\"r\">,<\/span> got the...<\/em> \\n - . <em>..sea are much more clear <span class=\"r\">,<\/span> and the ozone layer ...<\/em> \\n The above examples use an Oxford comma. \\n Do not use a semi-colon in the part that indicates: ... environmental pollution; animals... That should use a colon instead. \\n The following are questions, not things people said. These are things people asked and should use a question mark at the end of every sentence: \\n - what good can this virus bring \\n - how can we look at the positive side at such a time \\n What and how connote questions. You cannot agree with questions. However, you can ask the same questions or, you can give responses to the hypothetical questions. \\n When a person thinks, he will not have a \"faster\" truth.

This approach to the topic is both relevant and engaging, showcasing an ability to think critically and creatively. The title of the essay is particularly effective in capturing the reader's attention, demonstrating the importance of a well-chosen title.\n\nOne area for improvement lies in the use of vocabulary. Expanding your word choice would significantly enhance the sophistication of the essay. This involves moving beyond basic language to incorporate more intermediate-level words, which can help convey your ideas more precisely and compellingly.\n\nRegarding sentence structure, incorporating commas correctly can greatly improve the readability of the essay. Commas are useful for:\n- Introducing sentences, as in \"To prove this,\"\n- Separating items in a list (also known as the Oxford comma), for example, \"the children didn't talk to their parents, were uninterested in family affairs, and were total freeloaders.\"\n\nProper punctuation is crucial for clear communication. For instance, instead of using a semi-colon in the statement about environmental pollution, a colon would be more appropriate to introduce the examples that follow. Additionally, when posing rhetorical questions such as \"what good can this virus bring\" and \"how can we look at the positive side at such a time,\" it is important to end these phrases with a question mark to accurately convey their interrogative nature.\n\nWhen expressing agreement or presenting arguments, it is more logical to respond to the ideas or questions raised rather than the questions themselves. Phrasing such as \"the more we think, the more we realize\" is preferable to suggest a gradual understanding or realization, rather than a sudden, speed-based conclusion.\n\nIn summary, your essay effectively addresses the topic by presenting a unique viewpoint. To enhance your future essays, focus on expanding your vocabulary, paying careful attention to punctuation and grammar, and refining your argumentation strategy. These changes will not only clarify your ideas but also make your writing more compelling and coherent."}

However, the question of how to adopt such assets remains a source of constant debate. A school of thought holds that traveling is redundant, while obtaining knowledge through other forms of media such as books, films or the Internet is far more efficient. Much as the latter approach possesses certain validity, but educational benefit of travelling is simply irreplaceable. \\n It is understandable why people argue that acquiring cultural understanding via media is one of the most optimal methods. The key rationale is that the news from every aspect of life such as politics, cultures and entertainments all over the world are ubiquitous on the Internet, which is accessible to almost all people, especially in the light of technology advancements. For example, the flourishing of film industry contributes enormously to our aspiration of exploring both national and alien traditions, as a plethora of movies has vividly depicted the whole society and people's life of each region. Furthermore, not everyone can afford the enough time and budget for trips to different destinations, so a fertile source of online information is unarguably more cost-effective. \\n Notwithstanding the paramount advantages of media platforms, I am convinced that travelling is a more holistic approach. In other words, one can immerse in authentic culture and gain firsthand experiences during an overseas trip, while newspapers, books or social networks sometimes can impart false messages, biased perspectives or even over-glorify image of a country, which might ingrain prejudices and misunderstandings. At the same time, there are numerous facets that are hard to visualize via verbal description or visual aids such as social conventions or standard manners. In Western lifestyle, for instance, people customarily keep a certain distance from each other when having a conversation, where as in other cultures, the closeness of physical distance is taken as a sign of mutual trust. This is a testament to the role of travelling as a catalyst that cements one's cultural knowledge. \\n As outlined above, while the significance of media for cross-cultural acquisition is irrefutable, I believe there are several positive impacts of travelling that should be given equal consideration.","human_feedback_text":"The writer has totally changed the central discussion topic by changing the topic and reasoning points in the restatement.

There is an implied opinion in the third paragraph, but it will not be enough to help this essay gainer a passing score due to other word usage and GRA problems in the presentation..","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay on the importance of intercultural understanding, and whether traveling or media serves as the best medium to achieve this, makes for an engaging read. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, adherence to the task, and overall persuasive power.\n\n1. **Adherence to the Topic and Task Requirements:** The essay slightly misses the mark in directly answering the prompt. The question seeks a clear stance on the extent of agreement or disagreement with the statement that \"the educational benefit of traveling is simply irreplaceable.\" The essay should start with a clear response to this question before elaborating on the reasoning. Instead of diving directly into the discussion, it's crucial to explicitly state your agreement or disagreement at the beginning to meet the essay's requirements. For instance, beginning with \"I strongly believe that the educational benefits of traveling are irreplaceable because...\" would make your stance clear from the outset.\n\n2. **Avoiding Balance Where a Clear Stance is Needed:** While it's commendable to recognize the validity of opposing views, this essay format demands a focus on validating your own viewpoint rather than providing a balanced discussion. When mentioning an opposing view, quickly pivot to why it's less compelling compared to your stance on traveling's irreplaceable educational value. This approach will strengthen your argument and ensure adherence to the task's requirements of expressing and supporting a clear opinion.\n\n3. **Clarity and Coherence:** There are instances where complex sentence structures and advanced vocabulary detract from the clarity of your arguments. While a rich lexicon is advantageous, prioritizing straightforward and direct expression can enhance understanding and impact. For example, instead of saying \"a plethora of movies has vividly depicted the whole society,\" you might say \"many movies provide clear pictures of different cultures.\"\n\n4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay demonstrates a strong command of language, yet minor grammatical and stylistic errors occasionally disrupt the flow. Paying close attention to article use (\"the\" and \"a\"), subject-verb agreement, and sentence structure will improve readability. Additionally, varying your sentence structures can make your writing more engaging.\n\n5. **Clear and Descriptive Arguments:** The essay benefits from strong examples and the use of descriptive language to argue for the irreplaceable value of travel. Moving forward, aim to directly connect each argument back to your main thesis more explicitly. For example, after discussing an aspect of travel, conclude with a sentence that reinforces how this supports the irreplaceable educational value of travel, maintaining focus on your main argument.\n\nIn conclusion, by directly stating your stance, focusing on supporting that stance without lending too much credence to the counterargument, clarifying your language, and refining your grammatical precision, your essay will become both more persuasive and more aligned with the task requirements.

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to better respond to the essay prompt, clarify your points, and improve the overall quality of the writing. Here are some specific suggestions:\n\n1. **Understanding the Essay Prompt**: Firstly, it's crucial to ensure that your essay directly addresses the question asked. The prompt seeks your agreement or disagreement on a specific statement, but your essay introduced a new question (\"How do celebrities become famous?\") and centered the discussion around this. In future essays, carefully restate the prompt in your introduction to make sure your essay aligns with what's being asked.\n\n2. **Sentence Structure and Grammar**: There are noticeable issues with sentence structure and grammar that affect the clarity of your arguments. For instance, punctuation marks like periods and commas are sometimes misplaced or missing, leading to run-on sentences or fragments. Practicing basic sentence structure and reviewing punctuation rules will help in making your writing more coherent and easier to understand.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Use**: It's important to use appropriate vocabulary that fits the context of your discussion. Words or phrases like \"trend to follow\" should be \"tend to follow,\" and the correct spelling for \"marihuana\" is \"marijuana.\" Misused or misspelled words can confuse readers and weaken your arguments. Building your vocabulary and using a dictionary can help improve your lexical resource.\n\n4. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay occasionally suffers from a lack of clarity and coherence, particularly when discussing the impact of celebrities. Ensure each paragraph presents a clear idea supported by examples or evidence, and use transition words to smoothly move from one idea to the next. This will make your arguments more persuasive and your essay easier to follow.\n\n5. **Discussing Both Sides**: Although you attempted to discuss both negative and positive influences of celebrities, the transition between these ideas was somewhat abrupt. Spend equal amounts of time on each perspective to provide a balanced view, and clearly distinguish your opinion from your discussion of each side.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion effectively summarizes your stance, but it could be strengthened by more clearly reinforcing your main arguments and suggesting a way forward or a solution. This will leave the reader with a strong sense of your position on the topic.\n\nRemember, writing is a skill that improves with practice and feedback. By focusing on addressing the essay prompt directly, improving grammar and sentence structure, using appropriate vocabulary, and clearly organizing your thoughts, you will make significant progress in your writing abilities.

A more effective approach would be to introduce the topic and summarize the arguments to be discussed without immediately disclosing your viewpoint. Then, present your opinion in a separate paragraph, allowing for a structured discussion that leads to your conclusion organically.\n\nRegarding grammar and sentence structure, there's significant room for improvement. Simple sentences often contain errors or are formed in a way that makes the ideas difficult to follow. Practice constructing clear, simple sentences before gradually building up to more complex structures.

A strong conclusion should succinctly summarize the main points discussed while reinforcing your stance. This was not fully achieved, making the essay's closure seem less impactful. Revise how conclusions are approached to ensure they effectively encapsulate the discussion and leave a lasting impression on the reader.\n\nTo enhance the essay further, focus on presenting clear and descriptive arguments. While the essay attempts to discuss both sides of the argument concerning animal use for human benefit, the points often lack specific examples or detailed explanations that could strengthen the author's position. Incorporating factual information, when appropriate, can lend credibility to your arguments and help illustrate your points more vividly.\n\nLastly, the way in which information is presented in the introduction should be reconsidered. Avoid divulging factual information or comprehensive opinions in this section; it serves to introduce the topic and outline the essay's structure.

I do not agree with this opinion because there are several other effective ways we can take to deal with those problems. \\n Advocate argued that price increases can reduce the use of private cars and relief the pollution problem for two reasons. The price-sensitive drivers tend to give up using cars as their choice of vehicle to commute or travel around. As the number of cars decreased, the traffic jam would be relived as well.

Instead of simply disagreeing, consider stating how strongly you disagree, such as \"I strongly disagree,\" to provide a clearer stance.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Your essay has instances of grammatical errors and incorrect word usage. For example, the word \"occlusion\" is mistakenly used instead of \"conclusion.\" Such mistakes can confuse readers and affect the clarity of your message. Also, pay attention to using the correct form of words, like using \"advocates\" (plural) instead of \"advocate\" (singular) when you\u2019re referring to more than one person advocating for something. Ensuring correct tense and singular\/plural forms will enhance the readability of your essay.\n\n3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view is clear, but it could be made stronger with the use of specific phrases indicating the extent of your agreement or disagreement. Strengthening the introduction with a more definitive statement about your stance will set a clearer direction for your essay.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: You provide good alternative solutions to address the problems of traffic and pollution. However, it is essential to further develop these ideas with more detailed examples or data that support why these alternatives are better. Introducing, elaborating on, and providing evidence for each suggested solution would make your argument more convincing.\n\n5. **Vocabulary and Word Choice**: Building a stronger vocabulary and understanding the precise meaning of words is crucial. Misusing words can lead to confusion and weaken your argument. Practice using vocabulary that is appropriate for the context and double-check definitions if you are unsure.\n\n6. **Structure and Presentation**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure, ensuring each paragraph focuses on a single idea or argument, supported by examples or evidence. This will help in making a compelling case for your viewpoint.\n\nImproving these aspects of your essay will not only enhance its clarity and persuasiveness but also ensure it fully responds to the essay prompt. Practice writing with these tips in mind to develop your skills further."}

It is argued that these events can bring many benefits to the host country. Personally, I completely agree with this view and this essay will clarify my view further. \\n First and foremost, a chance to host a global sports event can bring about a good opportunity to boost the local economy through tourism. Once a country has been chosen as the gathering place of an event, it will certainly become the centre of attraction. To be more specific, there will be more infrastructure built to meet the demand of visitors from all over the world. As a result, the living standards of the local will also be raised, and there is likely to be a dramatic development in the domestic economy. Take Russia for example. Their people and government gained a lot of money during the 2018 World Cup that took place there. \\n In addition, a competition held in the native country can create a more relaxing environment for the local athletes. In particular, when they come out into the stadium, they know for sure that most of the audiences are supporting them through applause, slogans and yellings. That will obviously give them strength and motivation to play against the other team. Moreover, the host country will have the priority over others in terms of adding their favourable sports as well as eliminating disadvantageous ones. \\n In conclusion, a country can benefit a lot from an international sports event through both material and spiritual aspects.","human_feedback_text":"This is a multiple point of view and comparison discussion.

Opinion essay.","essay_text":"A pregnant female could take at least 10 weeks as a leave with actual payment. Such phenomenon leads to some suggest that without hiring those young females in the first place, small firms could avoid paying the pregnancy leave in the future. In this essay, I completely disagree with the statement and will provide my reasons as follows. \\n One primary reason is that selectively recruit people out of unmarried females is a form of discrimination. In our modern society, males and females are equal in terms of seeking job positions. Females workplace skills and understandings are no less than men. When a company decides to choose a person simply based on their fertilities, it discriminates a large number of unmarried women. This inappropriate hiring process of a company might end up getting sued by many females eventually. \\n Moreover, avoiding to hire young females as employees is a big loss to a firm as many of them are intelligent. Nowadays, many independent women are very successful in their lives such as Saoirse Ronan and Jennifer Lawrence. Their dedications to work are determined and motivated. When firms concentrate on the issue of maternity leave as a reason to not hire young females, these companies are missing to see a bigger picture. As female contributions could be significant. \\n Finally, some laws protecting females from being sexist are existing. Take Poland for instance, a country is defined as an act of criminal when a firm hires a person is based on their genders rather than their educational backgrounds or work experiences. This law can definitely protect millions of women work opportunity. Especially to those women who have not had their own families yet. \\n To recapitulate, man and woman have the same values in looking for occupational roles regardless their genders. By discarding a large proportional group of young females, companies would lose some of the most potentially valuable assets of staffs. A perfect example is Poland, a nation that tends to protect women from workplace discrimination by imposing a law as a prevention.","human_feedback_text":"SG, I don't advice writing more than 250 words in the essay because of the time constraint and the amount of work that you have to do as a test taker prior to submitting this for a score. You have to accomplish the following in no more than 40 minutes: \\n 1. Outline the discussion you will be presenting \\n 2. Draft the essay \\n 3. Review the essay for content relevance \\n 4. Revise the essay for content \\n 5. Edit any grammatical and spelling errors \\n Those are the reasons why I believe that you should write more than 250 words during the test.

Firstly, it's crucial to ensure the essay directly responds to the given topic. Any introduction of new information, such as the \"10 weeks\" detail regarding maternity leave, should be thoroughly explained and integrated into the body paragraphs where it supports the argument, rather than introduced without context in the opening segment.\n\nFocusing on word count and efficient writing is exceptional advice. For an English proficiency test, where time is a considerable constraint, aiming for about 250 words is practical. This limitation encourages conciseness and clarity, allowing you to outline, draft, review, revise, and edit your essay effectively within the allocated 40 minutes. \n\nRegarding content, the use of examples is vital in strengthening an argument. However, the choice of examples like actors, who may not face the same workplace challenges as those in time-sensitive professions, could be misleading. Instead, referencing professionals such as doctors, lawyers, or teachers, who cannot easily take extended time off, would provide a more compelling argument about the value of young women in the workforce.\n\nThe clarity of the essay\u2019s point of view is paramount. Ensure your stance is explicitly clear from the introduction through to the conclusion. While the essay takes a definitive stance against discrimination of young females in the workplace, strengthening this viewpoint with clear, specific, and relatable examples will make the argument more persuasive.\n\nOn grammar, spelling, and stylistic issues, maintaining a formal and professional tone is key. For instance, referring to \"a pregnant female\" might be more appropriately phrased as \"pregnant women\" or \"individuals.\" Attention to detail in grammar, such as the use of \"avoiding to hire\" which should be \u201cavoid hiring,\u201d will improve the readability and professionalism of the essay.\n\nLastly, the conclusion should succinctly reiterate the main points while directly tying back to the prompt to keep the essay focused and cohesive. It's beneficial to remind readers of the primary discussion and your stance on it at the end to reinforce your argument.\n\nBy addressing these points, focusing on relevant, strong examples, and ensuring a clear, concise structure within the suggested word limit, the essay can significantly improve in both clarity and impact."}

Your essay should start by clearly paraphrasing this statement and stating your position in relation to it.

Personally, I partly agree with this statement as I believe that whether or not someone can accomplish their aims relies heavily on a variety of other factors. \\n On the one hand, I accept that luck plays an important role in one's success. The presence of luck can be reflected in opportunities that people may come across during their journeys to realizing their aims. As a matter of fact, these chances can do wonders for them in several ways such as providing them with novel skills and knowledge or giving them a promotion in their jobs. In addition, luck is manifested in a person's family background. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into a wealthy family, and therefore they are provided with sufficient means that allow them to achieve their goals. Innate talents may be also regarded as a form of luck since not many people can excel in their fields and have capability to fulfill their ambitions by nature. \\n On the other hand, I believe that other factors should be given equal considerations. Firstly, fulfilling an ambition requires an immense passion because this factor is a guarantee that people will be determined, resilient and learn to overcome every adversary and failure. Secondly, people who want to thrive need to manage their emotions properly so that they can respond to negative situations rationally rather than emotionally. Finally, without proper and sufficient social skills, people can hardly achieve their goals. This is because they may not receive any support from social surroundings and have to shoulder all responsibilities on their own, leading to exhaustion and as a result reduction in work efficiency. \\n In conclusion, while luck can contribute to one's success to some extent, I hold the view that other subjective factors are also of vital importance.","human_feedback_text":"While you could partly agree with the statement, you will get score demerits because of your lack of clear opinion regarding the given topic. You see, the extent essay requires you to deliver an emotional response in relation to the degree of your support or not support for the discussion. As such, your TA score will be lower than you expected as there is a lack of clarity regarding your actual opinion based on the given discussion. \\n You will notice that your response is flip-flopping all over the place, trying to defend both points of view, without really making a clear point. That is the lack of clarity in your discussion. What you are saying is actually \"I agree, but also disagree.\" Does that make sense to you? Exactly. You cannot indicate an agreement with both opinions mostly because that means you do not have an opinion. A true extent essay works this way; think of what makes your agree or disagree strongly with the statement and then use 2 reasoning paragraphs to explain it. You could say: \\n <em>When one considers the factors involved, one would easily see how incorrect this statement is. It is based on 2 strong reasoning factors that I hold a heavy disagreement with the discussion points presented.<br\/><br\/>Those who agree with this statement indicate that... Upon personal consideration though, I tend to feel the opposite in an extreme manner because...<br\/><br\/>Along with the others who disagree, we share the point of view that... This is the strongest supporting consideration for our opinion that...<\/em> \\n Your opinion has to be clearly in support of one point of view, even if it is only to a certain extent. The format above will help you show the considerations that could make you \"partly\" agree with the discussion, but in the end, allows you to offer a strong singular opinion, which is the requirement for the extent essay. \\n Your concluding paragraph should properly summarize the topic, your point of view, and the reasons for it. Your presentation doesn't do that and, it still offers an unclear point of view in the presentation. \\n It is because of problematic first essay presentations that I do not score essays immediately. I will wait for your second essay and score you then. In, the meantime, I will be using this essay to assess your writing and comprehension abilities. No scoring, no problem section indicators, mostly because your format did not deliver the expected discussion type. I'll score you next time.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay offers an interesting perspective on the importance of luck in achieving success, balancing the influence of luck against other impactful factors. However, to enhance your essay and more effectively communicate your ideas, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Clarity of Opinion:** It's crucial to express a clear stance on the topic. Your current approach appears to agree with both sides without making a decisive argument. For a more persuasive essay, decide whether you mostly agree or disagree with the statement. Then, use your essay to support this viewpoint decisively. Offering a clear opinion is not just about choosing a side; it's about guiding your reader through your reasoning in a way that is unmistakably clear.\n\n2. **Expression of Personal Position**: While discussing both sides of an argument can add depth to your essay, it's essential to return to your main argument or viewpoint. Don't just present both sides; emphasize which side you lean towards and why. This makes your essay more compelling and provides a clearer guide for your reader.\n\n3. **Structure and Argument Development:** Consider structuring your essay so you introduce your main argument early on. Follow this with paragraphs that each focus on a distinct reason supporting your viewpoint. For example, if you believe that other factors are more important than luck, dedicate one paragraph to passion, another to emotional intelligence, and another to social skills, explaining how each contributes more to success than luck.\n\n4. **Concluding Summary:** Your conclusion should summarize your viewpoint and the reasons you've presented in support of it. It should leave the reader with a clear understanding of your position. Ensure that your conclusion doesn't introduce new ideas or ambiguity about your stance.\n\nRegarding language and writing style:\n- Your essay is well-written with minor spelling or grammatical issues. Keep an eye on maintaining a consistent tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement.\n- Consider varying your sentence structure to engage the reader more. This includes mixing complex and simple sentences to create a rhythm in your writing.\n\nIn terms of strengthening arguments:\n- Provide specific examples to illustrate your points. For instance, when mentioning how passion or social skills contribute to success, a brief real-life example could make your argument more relatable and convincing.\n- Highlight how the factors you deem important can sometimes create opportunities that might be perceived as luck, thereby integrating the idea of luck into a broader perspective of success.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, your essay can become more persuasive, coherent, and engaging, effectively communicating your viewpoint to the reader."}

However, there are some areas that require improvement to enhance the clarity, effectiveness, and adherence to typical essay requirements for English proficiency tests. Here's a breakdown of feedback focusing on the aspects mentioned:\n\n1. **Relevance to Topic:** Your essay attempts to address the topic by discussing the population trends of students in Australian universities. However, it lacks specific details about the graph itself, such as the type of graph and more comprehensive information it presents. Including these details could make your response more relevant and informative.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**\n   - There are a few spelling errors (\"catergorize\" should be \"categorize\", \"Autralia\" should be \"Australia\", \"constanly\" should be \"constantly\", \"fluctuate\" should be \"fluctuated\", \"stuudents\" should be \"students\").\n   - The usage of the term \"graph was increasing\" is incorrect; it should be rephrased for clarity, perhaps as \"the populations shown in the graphs were increasing\".\n   - Be cautious of plural and possessive forms (\"total students of both graph\" should be \"the total number of students in both graphs\"; \"overseas student's graph\" could be clarified as \"the graph showing overseas students\").\n   - Consider revising phrases for better readability (e.g., \"dramatically rocketed by 400%\" could be simplified to \"dramatically increased by 400%\").\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your essay presents an analytical viewpoint, focusing on the comparison between local and overseas students\u2019 enrolments. However, the clarity of your perspective could be enhanced by explicitly stating your interpretation or main takeaway from the data presented in the graphs.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** While you provide an overview, the essay lacks detailed arguments or specific examples to support your observations. Mentioning exact figures, years of significant changes, and possibly reasons behind trends could strengthen your position and make the essay more compelling.\n\nAdditionally, keep in mind the essay's word count. Your essay is under the minimum word requirement for most English proficiency tests, which could impact your score. Aiming for between 150-190 words, and not exceeding 200, ensures you meet the criteria without risking penalties for a technicality such as word count.\n\nImproving on these points could greatly enhance the quality of your essay, making it more informative, clearer, and better aligned with English proficiency test standards.

IELTSTask2","essay_text":"Nowadays, English is being taught as a first language in many schools in favour of the regional languages. Some fear that if these are not given equal representation in the curriculum, they might be forgotten entirely. I am of the opinion that an attempt to protect regional languages should be made in these communities. \\n First off, I feel that any indigenous language in a particular region must be included in the coursework of every grade. In addition to that schools must conduct daily readings of the news in the morning assembly by the students in that language. This can be extended to yearly events that promote the literature or cultural background that comes with these local languages. The same can be done by non-academic institutions as well. This should inspire interest among students in finding out more about their community. \\n Moreover, there are many endangered languages currently in the world, and a large number of ancient languages that we can barely decipher anymore. For example, the Persian language of one of the largest ancient empires is completely forgotten today. That said, we have also lost the ability to translate their texts accurately. Which leads to gaps in our knowledge of their society. Ideas and concepts that we could instead learn from are now shrouded in obscurity. \\n Finally, English is certainly an important language to learn simply due to its global influence on science, commerce and academia. By no means does that indicate that we must allow a local language to fizzle out of existence especially when we can prevent it.","human_feedback_text":"The writer has not provided a direct and acceptable response to the question: SHOULD WE TRY TO ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF LOCAL LANGUAGES? The paragraph that relates to this question presents a vague response at the most. It could use expanded discussions to help create a clearer sense of why local dialects are relevant to the country and why it should be preserved. \\n Questions have been provided in a specific series in the original presentation for a reason. The consecutive response presentations following the original concept creates an automatic ohesive and coherent content. Following the given format for the discussion would have ensured the highest possible score immediately in that scoring section. Being creative and mixing up the paragraph presentations can only be accomplished by writers who already know how to use transition sentences. T his writer does not have that ability yet. So the essay is not as well presented as it could have been. \\n There is no concluding paragraph in the essay. It is an automatic fail. Simply saying \" Finally\" does not create a concluding paragraph since the content of that paragraph does not provide concluding summary requirements.

However, to enhance your essay and fully address the topic, let's consider some areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: While you have touched upon the importance of preserving regional languages, the direct answer to the question of whether we should strive to ensure the survival of local languages is somewhat vague. Clearly stating your stance in the introduction and conclusively in the conclusion would strengthen your argument. Consider expanding on why local dialects are crucial, not just for the community but also for broader educational and cultural reasons.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: You've managed to keep spelling and grammar errors to a minimum, demonstrating a good grasp of English. However, paying attention to smoother transitions between paragraphs and ideas would improve the readability and flow of your essay. Using transition sentences effectively would help in maintaining a structured argument throughout.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view is understandable but could be made clearer by directly stating your position in the opening paragraph. A definitive stance assists readers in following your argumentation more effectively throughout the essay.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: The arguments for preserving local languages, such as protecting endangered languages and the cultural heritage they carry, are valuable. Yet, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into specific reasons and examples that highlight the relevance of local languages in a global context. Discussing how the preservation of local languages can contribute to a richer, more diverse culture globally would offer a more compelling argument.\n\nLastly, the essay currently lacks a concluding paragraph that summarizes your points and restates your position. This is crucial for concluding your narrative cohesively and reinforcing your argument. Remember, a conclusion serves to wrap up your discussion neatly and leaves the reader with a final impression of your stance.\n\nIn summary, there's a lot of potential in your essay to convey a powerful message about the importance of preserving local languages. With clearer structuring, direct answering of the question, more in-depth arguments, and the inclusion of a conclusive summary, your essay would significantly improve, both in clarity and impact."}

This is because nowadays people can easily access the news from online news portals through their gadgets.

We do not need to wait for the next day to know what is happening around the world. In addition, people can pick a variety of news articles from different agencies according to their preference. \\n On the other hand, I disagree that printed books will become extinct. This is because printed books are somewhat a collectable object. Certain people are passionate of collecting books and have personal libraries at home. Public libraries will also still need to purchase physical books to enrich their collections. Another reason is that reading printed books is much more favourable compared to e-books due to several factors. Reading e-books cause ocular discomfort due to the light emitted from gadgets. Some people also like to take notes with pens or pencils and highlight sentences on their books. Although this could be done on digital files as well, it is more convenient to do it on paper. Moreover, e-books are actually not free and I believe buying printed books is more worth the value than e-books. \\n To sum up, I believe that printed newspapers and books might see a different fate in the future: the first will see their dawn and the latter will likely survive.","human_feedback_text":"Your response to the direct question is incorrect.

This change can help maintain a formal tone throughout the essay. \n\n3. **Clarity of the Essay Author's Viewpoint:** The viewpoint is clear but needs to align more closely with the essay question. Instead of dividing the discussion into separate sections for newspapers and books, consider discussing them together as printed materials versus digital ones. This approach ensures that your essay stays focused on the central question of whether printed materials will be bought if available online for free.\n\n4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** The essay provides good arguments regarding the convenience and appeal of digital news and the tangible benefits of printed books. To strengthen these arguments, consider discussing the broader implications of digital versus print materials. For instance, the environmental impact of each or the digital divide that might affect access to digital materials for certain populations. This can provide a more holistic view of the topic.\n\n5. **General Suggestions:** It\u2019s important to ensure that every argument made is directly answering the essay question. Each point should clearly show your stance on the extent to which you agree or disagree that people won't buy printed materials if they are available online for free. Using examples and citing credible sources could also improve the strength of your arguments.\n\nIn summary, focus on closely responding to the essay question, maintain a formal tone, ensure your viewpoints are clear and directly related to the question, and support your arguments with a variety of insights and examples.

While this practice could present drawbacks relating to time management and teenagers 'exploitation, from my point of view, the overall impact is tremendously positive. \\n On the one hand, that the young could derive substantial benefits from such works is in plain sight. First, volunteering may inspire in them a spirit of dedication and responsibility. As it is observed that the youth are intrinsically inclined to show scant concern for their surroundings, voluntary works could be a chance for them to dig deeper insight into lives of their fellow citizens, especially the underprivileged. With such activities as collecting trash under sizzling weather or delivering food, teenagers can grow into empathetic citizens who realize their accountability to the society. Furthermore, unpaid work could facilitate a safe and secured career. To be more specific, employers are apt to appreciate those taking part in voluntary work and contribute to the society since these candidates are considered to be equipped with requisite practical skills. Google, a large multinational firm, only recruit employees that have even-handed experience. Lacking this, candidate could fall behind by their competitors. As it shows, voluntary work could be beneficial. \\n On the other hand, there might be some drawbacks that need mentioning. The main reason is their shortage of time. Undoubtedly, teenagers have to allocate much of their time on study, however, volunteering means they need set aside a considerable time for such works. This, in practice, is annoying for those in final grade who prepare for the entrance exam. Consequently, diminuting study time could culminate in their poor academic performance coupled with a bleak career prospect. Moreover, that the young could be taken advantage seems liable. This is because several organizations endeavor to promote their image through such voluntary activities. Thanh Cong, a Vietnam food company, used to ask young participants to distribute flyers to raise public health awareness, but they actually contained adverts for their products with an aim to proliferate their sales instead. Therefore, it presents several drawbacks when it comes to volunteering of teenagers. \\n In conclusion, while the youth's partaking in voluntary work represents such downsides mentioned above, these are surpassed by such benefits as responsibility and career fulfilment.

Instead, it frames the discussion in terms of positive and negative implications, which subtly shifts the focus away from the original prompt. To improve, aim to directly compare the advantages and disadvantages in a balanced way, adhering closely to what the prompt asks.\n\n2. **Clarity and Focus**: The essay introduces several examples to support its points but seems to go off track, particularly when discussing employment opportunities associated with volunteering. While such details can be enriching, they might detract from the main focus. To refine your essay, it's advisable to select a single, clear example that directly supports your discussion. Then, expand on this example by explaining its relevance and implications, focusing on logic and reasoning.\n\n3. **Understanding the Prompt**: The essay somewhat misinterprets the prompt by offering an opinion on whether youth should engage in volunteering, rather than comparing different viewpoints as instructed. For improvement, carefully read the prompt to ensure understanding and address the task as requested. This might involve presenting both sides of the argument neutrally and weighing them against each other, instead of advocating for one perspective.\n\nRegarding the essay's writing aspects:\n- **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are some minor spelling and grammatical issues that need attention, for example, the phrase \"teenagers 'exploitation\" seems to be missing an apostrophe for possession (teenagers' exploitation). Additionally, consider using simpler language and shorter sentences to enhance clarity, especially considering the target audience of English language learners.\n- **Clearness of Author's Point of View**: While the essay's point of view is clear, ensuring alignment with the prompt\u2019s requirements could strengthen the author's position. When offering an opinion, substantiate it with logical reasoning based on the prompt's directives.\n- **Descriptive Arguments**: The essay does well in trying to provide arguments for its stance. However, focusing on more targeted examples and elaborating on them with logic and reasoning, directly related to the prompt, will make the arguments stronger and more convincing.\n\nIn summary, the essay has potential but would benefit significantly from a closer alignment with the prompt's requirements, clearer focus and reasoning, and attention to grammatical accuracy. Simplifying the language to ensure clarity and making sure that the examples directly support the point being made will also enhance the effectiveness of the essay."}

When older adults retire, which means in several circumstances they will not have any income, authorities should certainly provide the retired with financial assistance to at least help maintain their basic living conditions, including food, medical care, and housing. The second reason is during the working period, senior citizens contributed to the country and the community through their participation in the labor force, tax payments, and contributions to economic development. I believe it is justifiable for the authority to provide support during their later life. \\n However, depending solely on the government's plans poses risks to retired people. The problem is governments frequently subsidize retirees with pension schemes that will not work for another 30-40 years. With inflation, most of the time, the monthly allowance provided falls short of fully covering retirees' medical expenses for serious illnesses, not to mention discretionary spending such as travel expenses, and other forms of entertainment. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that people of working age need to consider other financial security measures such as retirement funds and saving money in bank accounts as soon as possible.","human_feedback_text":"This sort of essay requires you to present varied justifications in the reasoning paragraphs. You need to support your opinion with 2 related supporting ideas. That is because you are expected to deliver a convincing argument that proves your opinion to be the correct one. What you did here, defending both sides of the essay, will result in a failing score. The discussion presentation is incorrect. The examiner is not going to give you any credit for the paragraph that runs against your actual opinion, the one that is stated in the prompt restatement section. You will get a score based on an under developed opinion in this case. The essay will also be considered as presenting less than the minimum word count since the second paragraph will be totally disregarded.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay provides an interesting perspective on the role of government in supporting retirees, highlighting both the necessity of government subsidies and the importance of individual financial planning. Nonetheless, there are several areas where improvement could be greatly beneficial.\n\nFirstly, while the essay addresses the topic, it ventures into presenting arguments for both sides rather than firmly supporting one stance as instructed. This approach could potentially confuse the reader and weaken the essay's overall impact. It's crucial to adhere to the essay prompt's requirement, which, in this case, implies selecting and robustly defending one viewpoint throughout the essay.\n\nRegarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is generally well-written but could still benefit from minor revisions for clarity and flow. Paying closer attention to the use of commas for pacing and the structure of complex sentences could enhance readability.\n\nThe author's point of view, though evident, gets muddled by the attempt to argue for both sides. Maintaining a clear and consistent stance would not only strengthen the argument but also align with the expectations of the essay task.\n\nMoreover, while the essay does present arguments to support its points, the reasoning could be further fortified by concentrating solely on arguments that back the chosen stance. Dedicating each body paragraph to a distinct, supporting argument with clear examples and explanations would significantly bolster the essay's persuasiveness.\n\nAn essential aspect to consider is the structure of the essay regarding the task requirements. As noted, presenting arguments that counter your chosen stance can obscure your viewpoint and may lead to a misconception that the essay is underdeveloped in its argumentation. This deviation from the task's instructions could adversely affect the overall score. To correct this, it is advisable to focus entirely on supporting the selected viewpoint with well-developed arguments and examples, thus ensuring a coherent and convincing essay.\n\nFinally, consider concluding the essay with a stronger restatement of your position and a summary of the key points made in support of your argument. This not only reaffirms your stance but also assists in leaving a lasting impression on the reader.\n\nIn summary, focusing on a singular perspective, enhancing the clarity and consistency of your argument, and adhering closely to the essay instructions would substantially improve the effectiveness and the persuasive quality of your essay."}

Biases brought many negative effects on scientific research, resulting in slowing down the development of science, the inaccuracy of scientific research and reduced authenticity. \\n Bias slowed down the progress of science. Gender bias is part of them. There is a huge unbalance of genders for the scientists in some area of research such as geophysics and biomedicine. The lack of female is a type of the lack of diversity, which caused different ideas to be less. The research indicates that women have different views for a problem due to their different life experience compared with males, so the lack of female in the scientific research results in some wonderful ideas cannot be came up (Vanessa, A., 2018). The absence of some ideas is not the only way that the progress of science was affected, the gender bias also caused a loss of talents. The research carried in the Yale University indicates that women are 20% less likely to be hired for a position in scientific researches even they have the similar applications as male (Moss-Racusin et al, 2012). This means there are many extraordinary female scientists cannot get the chance to participate in science and be replaced by some males who are not as good as them, which is not good for scientific research since fewer talents can contribute to the research. \\n Bias reduces the accuracy of the scientific research. Selection bias in one of the systematic errors and it often caused the scientists cannot select the sample that can represent all of the objectives. For example, when researchers studied the average hsCRP (high sensitive C-reactive protein) concentration for people in Croatia, they used the sample from volunteer blood donors rather than recruiting individuals from a general population. The result of the hsCRP concentration was lower than the real level because volunteer blood donors were usually those who thought themselves were healthy so they were unlikely to have those diseases which might cause changes in hsCRP concentration (\u0160imundi\u0107, 2013). The inaccuracy of the scientific research may lead scientists cannot get the correct solution. \\n Bias causes decreased authenticity of scientific research, which makes the scientific research cannot provide objective and correct results. Citation bias is also one of the systematic errors and it refers to that the researchers or the sponsors of the experiment are unwilling to publish some unfavorable results. For instance, generally, industry funded trials are 4 times more likely to have a flattering result. This is because those negative data were hidden and those positive data that could support the industry's opinion was highlighted and used repeatedly to convince customers that the drugs are effective (Ben, 2012). This kind of bias leads the audiences cannot get objective information about the research and mislead others to make wrong decisions. \\n In conclusion, bias has many negative effects on the scientific research, which slows down the development of science, affected the accuracy of the scientific research and affected the authenticity of the scientific research.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, you have too many topics under discussion in this research paper but not enough in discussion in terms of topic development. I am really confused at this point regarding which type of bias should be focused on in this paper and why I should care about it. The opening statement does not deliver an accurate nor clear thesis statement regarding bias, which is probably why the paper appears to be directionless. Rather than trying to cover all types, causes, and effects of bias, it would be better if you focus your research on one or two related cases of bias in relation to the scientific aspect of the discussion. You can consider discussing how gender bias against women scientists has affected scientific research in a specific field. Then mention some successful research of female scientists that were prevented from being published because of gender bias. It will be a bit difficult for you to successfully discuss bias in general in relation to science because the field is too wide for discussion. You must narrow down the discussion in order to clarify the point of your paper. Do some topic brainstorming first. Then narrow down the topic till you are left with one important bias topic for discussion or two related topics. From there, outline the topics for discussion then look at whether or not you will be able to access relevant information for it. Right now, your essay presents the topics for discussion but does not present an accurate discussion of each point. Which is what is causing the problems for your essay presentation. Figure out the point of the essay first, then revise the current content to go into the direction you need it to go in for the presentation.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay addresses the critical issue of bias in the scientific world, highlighting its negative impacts on scientific development, accuracy, and authenticity. However, there are several areas where improvements could help in making your arguments stronger and your essay more focused.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay does acknowledge the topic of bias in scientific research, but it lacks a focused thesis statement. A clear and focused thesis at the beginning would help guide the reader through your arguments more effectively. Consider narrowing down your focus to one or two types of bias\u2014like gender bias\u2014and explore its specific effects in detail. This approach will help in deepening your analysis and making your essay more compelling.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are a few punctuation and referencing style inconsistencies. For instance, when citing studies, maintaining a consistent format (e.g., using APA or MLA style throughout) would enhance the credibility of your essay. Also, paying attention to the use of singular and plural forms, as well as ensuring verb tense consistency, would improve readability.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Although your point of view is perceivable, it tends to get diluted across too broad a topic area. Focusing on specific instances or types of bias will not only clarify your standpoint but also allow for more in-depth analysis and argumentation. Clearly stating your main argument in your introduction will set a solid foundation for your viewpoint.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: Your essay does present arguments supporting the notion that bias affects scientific research negatively. However, your arguments sometimes lack depth due to the wide array of biases that you attempt to cover. Diving deeper into fewer topics, such as the impact of gender bias on employment opportunities and the quality of scientific research, would enable you to provide more detailed evidence and analysis. Incorporating examples of successful but unpublished research due to gender bias could further strengthen your argument.\n\nTo enhance your essay, start with refining your thesis to focus more narrowly on specific biases affecting scientific research. This will make your essay more organized and impactful. Next, outline and develop each argument with clear, relevant examples and evidence. Lastly, ensure your writing style is consistent, your grammar and spelling are correct, and your citations follow a standardized format.\n\nRemember, specificity is key to a powerful essay. By refining your focus and deepening your arguments, you can markedly improve the coherence and persuasiveness of your writing."}

Some people believe that animals should be treated like humans, the others think that animals are only used for researches or benefits. This essay will discuss both views and give some opinions. \\n On one hand, animals should be treated fairly because they like people in many ways. In other words, animals have emotions, they are intelligent and they know how to care and bring up their child. Thus, animals deserve to be treated as well as humans. For example, monkeys are extremely smart, dogs are the most loyal animals. In addition, humans depend on animals for survive, instead of proving food, they help people in many cases such as detections, cures, buildings, etc. \\n On the other hand, people should not give rights for all of animals. Firstly, the biggest difference between humans and animals is animals act instinctively, they can harm to people. Secondly, rights go with obligations, people have rights but they also have to contribute society and make a rich society. While animals can not do anything like this, proving food and research are their missions. Thus, people should care and love them instead of giving them the same rights as humans. \\n In my opinion, although animals can not have the same rights as human but animals should have some rights such as protection and risk of extinction. Because of a number of animals are on the verge of extinction such as mountain gorillas, South China tiger, etc. Besides, people use animals for research in order to decrease risks and cost. Thus, research on animals is permissible and people should not use animals unconsciously on research. \\n In conclusion, animals should have protection rights instead of having the same rights as humans. People should love animals and consider before using them on research.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, since you forgot to post the original prompt along with the essay response, I cannot give you any advice regarding the content of your essay.

I wish that I could have given you a more in-depth review of your essay but without the original prompt, that is just impossible. \\n You are missing a comma after your conjunction reference in the sentence \"... they are intelligent, and...\" . There a few more errors regarding conjunction punctuation use, specifically to a missing comma after the conjunction in several sentences. The comma is always used to connect separate sentence references \/ thoughts in a paragraph. Don't get used to doing that though because its consistent use in any paragraph often results in run-on sentences, which has a relation to a reduced GRA score. \\n Please remember that your word choices matter in this essay. The way you present a sentence wording will indicate either clarity or confusion. So, when you say \"can not\", you confuse the reader. The word \"can\" indicates an ability to accomplish while the word \"not\" means to disagree or, as referenced in this sentence, be unable to accomplish something. When you say can not, that mean you can but also are unable to. That doesn't make sense. However, saying \"cannot\" means \"being unable to\" in a contracted form. The word \"cannot\" is a contraction that refers to being unable to accomplish as opposed to \"can not\" which does not make sense as I previously explained.

Your effort to explore both sides of the argument is commendable, providing a balanced view which is essential for a persuasive essay. However, there are areas for improvement that could make your essay more effective and coherent.\n\n**1. Responding to the Topic:** Although the original prompt isn't provided, your essay seems to explore the idea of animals' roles in human society and their rights, which appears to be a relevant subject. In future essays, ensure that the prompt is included to clearly demonstrate how directly your essay addresses the topic.\n\n**2. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**\n\n- **Comma Usage:** Your essay shows inconsistent use of commas, especially after conjunctions. Proper comma placement is crucial to separate ideas and improve readability. For example, in \"... they are intelligent, and they know how to care...\" a comma is needed after \"intelligent\" to correctly separate the ideas.\n- **Clarity and Word Choice:** The difference between \"can not\" and \"cannot\" is significant, affecting the clarity of your sentences. \"Cannot\" is the correct form to indicate something that is impossible, while \"can not\" might confuse readers since it suggests a choice. Avoid separating \"can\" and \"not\" unless you aim to emphasize the 'not' part in your sentences.\n- **Sentence Structure:** Pay attention to creating varied and coherent sentence structures. This improves the flow and readability of your essay. Avoid run-on sentences that might make your essay hard to follow.\n\n**3. Clarity of Viewpoint:** Your personal standpoint becomes clear towards the end of the essay, which is good. However, articulating your stance earlier could strengthen your argument by immediately providing the reader with your perspective.\n\n**4. Supporting Arguments:** You provide interesting examples and reasons supporting both sides of the debate on how animals should be treated. To further strengthen your essay, deepen these arguments with more detailed examples or evidence. For instance, when mentioning how animals help humans in various fields like detection, cure, and building, providing specific examples or statistics can make your argument more persuasive.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n- **Introduction and Conclusion:** A clearer introduction of your main argument and a stronger concluding statement summarizing your viewpoint would make your essay stand out more. The conclusion could re-emphasize your stance on the importance of protection rights for animals without giving them identical rights to humans.\n- **Consistency:** Ensure consistency in your viewpoint throughout the essay to avoid confusing the reader.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect. Taking these points into consideration will not only improve this essay but also help you develop your writing skills further. Keep writing, and always seek to refine your craftsmanship."}

Many people are of the opinion that oral speeches overpower its paper counterpart all the time. From my perspective, while I agree spoken conversations have overwhelming advantages over written forms, I doubt if they do in all circumstances. \\n On the one hand, oral conversations truly prove to have more power in most scenarios. Firstly, daily communication takes place in almost any place any time because of its rapid delivery of messages followed by prompt response from others. For instance, it is crucial for most lectures to be vocally conducted in class whereas books are to be patiently read at home for preparation or post-class assignments. Secondly, by speaking out the messages, people can make use of the generous assistance of their voice. This includes the tones which help convey the speakers' emotions and the stresses which aid in emphasis of signigicant points. \\n On the other hand, though less dominant, there are certain cases in which written forms cannot be replaced. Regarding scientific researches, laborious experiments and meticulous observations need to be made in order for valuable findings and breakthroughs to be discovered. Thus, since these assets are too important to be stored as recordings or videos, paper and books serve as a better preservation. Furthermore, insightful books that embrace seas of knowledge and skills necessarily require much time from readers to keep track and apply piece by piece in their life. Not a single audio book version can overrule such uses of a traditional skill book. \\n In conclusion, oral language appears to be more powerful due to its supreme regularity and immediate effects from the voice. However, this is not always the case as written language communicates better in some other circumstances such as significant academic studies and skill-teaching materials.","human_feedback_text":"Stop adding information to your essay that is not found in the original presentation.

There are many reasons behind this. I completely agree with the above statement and will discuss the causes of this situation in this essay. \\n First of all, there is a widespread perception that women are not as productive as men, considering that at some point in time, they will have look after their offspring and families in lieu of their companies. Companies will, therefore, not promote women to higher-level positions such as management. For example, Tracey, one of my friend, wanted to become a CEO of a certain company and therefore worked painstakingly throughout her career. She was later rejected by the shareholders as she was a woman. Although they did not directly tell her that she was not chosen because of her gender, they did imply the fact that men would be preferred over women when it comes to choosing people for higher-level position. \\n Apart from this misconception about women, many women also demand to be paid as much as men when they do not contribute to their businesses as much as men do which aggravate this circumstance further. The perception of most companies about women has, therefore, worsened, rendering them to believe even more that men should take over those prestigious positions. For instance, multiple stories are published every day on magazines and newspapers, talking about how women feel disadvantaged without even knowing that the primary reason as to why they do not receive the same salary was due to their lack of contributions to their companies in comparison to men. \\n In conclusion, today many women are labelled as unproductive and work-shy which explains the reason why they are not chosen for superior positions. Some of them are not even aware how much expertise and skills they bring to the table. To reiterate, I firmly believe that women be given more opportunities to shine in the world.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, your opening paraphrase is not sufficient enough. You are still using too much of the original wording in your restatement. That makes it a very weak paraphrase. A strong paraphrase does not use any words from the original in its presentation.

For example, you might say: \"In many businesses, there is a clear preference for male employees in significant roles, disregarding that females often make up a majority of the workforce.\" This showcases your ability to interpret and rephrase ideas without directly borrowing from the original text.\n\n2. **Use of 'Therefore'**: You've used \"therefore\" frequently, and not always appropriately, which can disrupt the flow of your ideas. \"Therefore\" should seamlessly connect ideas; however, its misuse can lead to confusion or weakened arguments. In cases where you're showing cause and effect or reasoning, ensure \"therefore\" is used correctly and consider varying your transitions to improve readability. \n\n3. **Handling Plural Forms**: Pay attention to plural forms in your writing. For instance, \"Tracey, one of my friend\" should be \"Tracey, one of my friends.\" This attention to detail in grammar is important and impacts the overall professionalism and clarity of your essay.\n\n4. **Supporting Arguments and Examples**: While you provide examples to support your argument, such as the anecdote about Tracey, these could be further elaborated to strengthen your position. Clarify how these examples specifically demonstrate the issues at hand, and consider incorporating statistics or studies for a more convincing argument.\n\n5. **Conclusion Strength**: Your conclusion does a good job of summarizing your arguments and restating your stance. To further enhance it, reflect on the implications of your discussion or suggest potential solutions to the issue at hand. This not only reiterates your point of view but also shows critical thinking and a forward-looking approach.\n\n6. **Sentence Structure and Style**: Diversifying your sentence structures will not only make your essay more engaging but also showcase your language proficiency. Avoid repetitive structures or the overuse of certain words, and strive for a balance of complex and simple sentences to keep the reader's interest.\n\nRemember, each piece of writing is a step forward in developing your skills. By addressing these areas, you are not just working towards a higher score but also improving your overall English proficiency. Keep practicing, and incorporate these tips into your future essays for more polished and persuasive writing."}

This leads to a number of consequences, including a rise in cars. Although there are some benefits of this trend, I would argue that there are far more drawbacks. \\n On the one hand, there are a number of advantages of driving to large out-of-town stores. To begin with, shopping in city-suburban relieve pressure on housing supply systems. This is because shopping at out-of-town stores encourages people to move to out-of-town areas for living. To illustrate, Ho Chi Minh city is faced with overpopulation so when these citizens moved to other suburban places such as the Nha Be district will reduce the number of people living in the central of the city. In addition, the air pollution will reduce when there are fewer cars in city centers. In Ho Chi Minh city, when people move to Cu Chi for shopping, the gases from the exhaust will decrease in District 1. \\n On the other hand, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Firstly, local people will be put into inconvenience since they are difficult in traveling to a distant place to shop. For example, a lot of people living in District 6 do not have their private cars and it seems to be long-distance when they want to buy something at Dau Moi Market in Hoc Mon or Cu Chi. Secondly, driving to large out-of-town stores increase the unemployment rate in the local area because more malls will be located at other ot-of-town stores. When more stores open in out-of-town areas, these employers want to recruit their employees who live in nearer places in order to convenience in works. It might cause to unbalance career rate in that city. \\n In conclusion, while I recognized the possible advantages of this trend, I believe these advantages are overshadowed by the disadvantages of the aforementioned arguments.","human_feedback_text":"The essay will automatically receive a failing score because of 2 reasons: \\n - Prompt deviation \\n - Response is unrelated to the task \\n This is a 5 paragraph essay that should have provided 3 paragraph explanations based on 3 provided questions: \\n - What is the advantage of shopping in a shopping center? \\n - What is the advantage of shopping in a local market? \\n - What is your preference? \\n The author clearly wrote a response that does not apply to the provided oqquestions.

This choice of topic is both timely and relatable, indicating a good understanding of the task at hand.

While some assert that academic success is influenced by fellow students, others assume that parents have a more significant impact on their offsprings' results. From my perspective, classmates play a more imperative role in youngsters' scholastic achievements. \\n First and foremost, children spend much more time with their peers than with parents. Everyday, kids spend at least 8 hours studying on campus, thus they have a lot of chances to meet and interact with their fellow students. Besides, technological advances like the Internet and smartphone enable kids to contact with friends even when they are at home. In contrast, children meet their parents only at meal time and do not enjoying talking to them regarding their parents as conservative and out-dated. Consequently, children are much more intimate to their classmates than their parents. The intimacy between them is children's the prime source of mental assiatance, which contribute substantially to a successful academic life. \\n Secondly, school environment can create fierce competition among students. Children compete with peers through tests, examinations as well as groupwork and extracurricular activities. Not only do youngsters compete with peers to get good results but also compete to gain popularity to teachers and other mates. This competition gradually creates interest and enthusiasm, motivates students to work harder, define themselves and exceed their normal limits. Every child wants to stand out, to be ahead of its fellow student, to be the best. Classmate will be the ones determining the mental aspect of children and keep children invariably motivated in their journey to academic success \\n The mental assistance from peers is necessary for children.

From my perspective, while this new style of working and studying might be advantageous in some ways, I believe that it is a negative trend. \\n There are two main reasons why I state that home-working and home-studying are beneficial to workers and students. The first one is that those who are home-based employees may not only reduce the commute time but also ease worries about traffic congestion. Therefore, they can spend much more quality time on performing their jobs and cultivate themselves intellectually. The second one is that undergraduates who attend online courses can learn at their own pace and are able to arrange their personal schedules easily and efficiently. By doing this, they may enjoy daily full-flavoured meals with their family at home, which helps them maintain a healthy balanced lifestyle. \\n Nevertheless, it seems to me that disadvantages of tele-working and tele-education outweigh the aforementioned benefits for a number of reasons. First of all, it can be pretty costly to set up pieces of integral office equipment at home including high-end laptops, high-speed internet connection, printers and fax machines; thus, employees are unable to achieve full working progress because of the shortage of these necessary utensils. In addition, both workers and learners have no opportunities to interact directly with their colleagues and teammates, which makes them lack important social skills such as face to face communication, teamwork spirit and peer support. Besides, those working and studying at home have a tendency to sit or lie down in a chair are usually tempted into using mobile phones, playing computer games and watching videos. This could decrease their productivity and lead them to a sedentary lifestyle with many severe health problems. Last but not least, those who carry out their own duties at home are sometimes distracted by other family members or background noise; for instance, when a man is highly focused on his new financial report to submit it by the deadline, but all of a sudden, his children are crying loudly; thus, he cannot complete this report on time. \\n In conclusion, I admit that the enlargement of engaging in remote collaboration between staff and company as well as joining online courses might bring about advantages to some extent. However, I believe that this is a change for the worse since the direct interaction of working in office and learning in class is an essential part in our daily life.","human_feedback_text":"Okay, you made your point.

However, there are several areas for improvement to strengthen the argument and ensure the essay fully addresses the prompt.\n\n1. **Focus on the Prompt**: The essay should concentrate solely on whether remote working and online learning are positive or negative developments. It currently discusses both advantages and disadvantages. For a more focused response, choose one perspective (in this case, the negative aspects) and develop that point throughout the essay. Since the prompt asks for your view on this trend, it's important to stick to discussing the negatives of teleworking and telelearning as the core of your essay.\n\n2. **Relevance to the Topic**: The essay veers off-topic by discussing modern gadgets rather than focusing on computer technology, which is more relevant to the given theme. The accessibility and affordability of computer technology, which facilitates remote work and learning, should be the crux of the discussion. Emphasize how despite these advancements, there are significant drawbacks to depending solely on technology for work and education.\n\n3. **Development of Arguments**: While you have provided several reasons for your perspective, these need to be developed further for clarity and impact. Rather than listing reasons and moving on, delve deeper into each one. Explain why and how the disadvantages outweigh the benefits, providing specific examples and elaborating on each point. This will make your argument more persuasive and comprehensive.\n\n4. **Grammar and Style**: There are minor grammatical and stylistic issues that, when addressed, could improve the readability of the essay. Ensure each sentence flows logically to the next, and consider breaking up complex ideas into simpler, more concise sentences. This makes it easier for readers to follow your argument.\n\n5. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your point of view is generally clear but gets diluted by the mention of both pros and cons. Maintain a consistent stance throughout the essay to avoid confusing the reader. By focusing on your argument that the trend is negative, you will provide a stronger, more cohesive essay.\n\n6. **Supporting Arguments**: Your reasons for viewing the trend negatively need to be linked more explicitly to the accessibility and affordability of computer technology.

In my opinion, this trend would create certain positive sides but some negative effects as well. \\n On the one hand, it can be obviously seen that technology evolves leading to independence and increasing children's self-studying skills, which are necessary features to improve their mind-skills and also their independent perception. With the development of technological devices, children can easily study with a mass of knowledge and a world of resources updated and added daily and have to pay no fee. They may learn lots of things, not only some limited subjects at school but also life skills, languages, argumentative skills, ...etc, which they are not taught in some places like schools, extra classes. They totally can gain success with their fundamental possibilities as much as other students who enter studying levels at school. For instance, according to the New York Times, the percentage of students who are not going to school but can go into leading companies is the same as those who completed universities or high school degrees in 2017. \\n On the other hand, there will also be some negative points in self-studying at home for children. Opting to learn from home means students need to considerably choose the correct resources to study among a huge number of resources on the Internet. Choosing the right or wrong ways and sources to learn from may exert directly bad or good effects on your knowledge and result in the preciseness and accuracy of the information you absorb every day.","human_feedback_text":"The prompt restatement is confusing. It incorrectly implies that children and adults both benefit from attending school online. ' As far as the orginal prompt is concerned, these different age groups represent 2 different categories in relation to tech usage. Children use it for school, adults use it for work. That is the clear separation of topic focus which the writer incorrectly restated. That is a definite task inaccuracy that will reduce the score for the paragraph. \\n The writer's opinion is incorrect as well. Since this a single opinion essay and not a compare and contrast writing platform, the writer will be seen as not meeting the response and writing format. He does not provide an accurate opinion and discussion presentation since he used an extent \/ comparative explanation. These are the lasons a passing score will not be applied to this presentation. \\n Learn the different response format types and how these are applied to specific prompts \/ writing instructions in order to meet the task and response needs of the essays.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay provides a mixed perspective on the trend of learning at home versus traditional schooling, influenced by technological advances. However, there are several areas that require attention to improve alignment with the essay prompt and overall clarity.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** The introduction suggests that both children and adults are moving towards learning at home, which diverges from the prompt's focus. It's important to clearly distinguish between the learning contexts of these two groups, as the original topic differentiates their reasons for using technology. For a more accurate response, specify that children are engaging with technology mainly for educational purposes, whereas adults may use it for a broader range of activities, including work.\n\n2. **Opinion Clarity and Essay Format:** The essay attempts to present a balanced view by discussing both positive and negative aspects of technology in learning. However, this approach doesn't fully comply with the requirement for a single, clear opinion. Instead of offering a comparative analysis, focus on presenting a well-supported argument that reflects a definitive stance on the issue. Develop your position thoroughly with evidence and examples, ensuring that the essay has a coherent argument throughout.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Overall, the essay is well-written, but minor issues should be addressed for better clarity and professionalism. Pay attention to consistent tense usage and the correct placement of commas for smoother flow. Additionally, avoid ellipses (\"...etc\") in formal writing\u2014use complete sentences to convey your points clearly.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay mentions interesting points, such as the availability of diverse knowledge online and the development of self-study skills. However, these arguments need to be supported more robustly with evidence, statistics, or real-life examples, as seen with the reference to the New York Times. Further, when discussing the challenges of selecting appropriate resources online, provide specific strategies or criteria that could help learners make better choices. This will not only strengthen the argument but also offer practical advice to the reader.\n\nIn summary, focus on presenting a single, clear opinion that aligns with the topic, backed by solid arguments and evidence. Clarify the distinctions in technology usage between children and adults as indicated by the prompt, and refine the essay's structure and language for better readability and impact. With these adjustments, the essay will more effectively communicate its message and adhere to the response format expected for such prompts."}

However, I strongly believe that libraries are irreplaceable, as not only do they encourage a positive sense of belonging, they are also a more credible source of knowledge when compare to the Internet. \\n First of all, libraries offer beyond just simple information, they also bring people together and promote a tighter community connection. In fact, these places are often considered to be gathering locations that offer educational seminars and workshops. This means it facilitates get-togethers and discussions among learners, which in turn assist their learning development. As the result, local people would perceive libraries as a place to receive help, as well as acknowledge others' difficulties and support them. \\n Secondly, libraries contain physical books are generally more credible than the Internet. This is because before a book is published, there are strict procedures that authors need to follow. After that, that book is going through peer review and proofread. All these steps are to ensure that the information provided is reliable. On the other hand, Internet is more relaxed in terms of restriction, which leads to some websites providing writer's opinions rather than proved facts. The inconsistent of information accuracy results in the readers being confused or believing in incorrect data. \\n In conclusion, even with the growing popularity of the Internet, I absolutely believe in the importance of maintaining and developing public libraries. Not only do they promote a strong relationship within the community, they are also the most reliable source of information.","human_feedback_text":"This is an almost excellent essay that should score above the simple passing band score. In my opinion, this essay is a good example of a starting at 7 band score presentation. Why? \\n - You properly responded to the prompt question, although you should have indicated that you believe that libraries are still a necessity rather than being irreplaceable. The former being more in tune with the original prompt. Necessity = something indispensable, irreplaceable = unique or cannot be replaced. The words have 2 different meanings. indispensable being the more vocabulary appropriate word to use in the relation to the given discussion. \\n - You focused your reasoning paragraphs on supporting your point of view regarding the given topic \\n - Your discussion paragraphs are solidly developed in a clear and connected manner \\n - Your conclusion covered all of the required elements \\n You indicated that the internet and libraries are a source of education. Rather, these are sources of information. Education just happens to be a side effect of the pursuit of information. I know, I am nitpicking, but you want to have the most perfect essay presentation right? That starts with an accurate restatement of the given discussion. You never know what may add or deduct from your scoring considerations. \\n While the grammar is far from perfect, the clarity by which you presented your information made up for any grammatical errors in terms of simple and complex sentence presentations and lack of other punctuation mark usage (other than a period and comma). Again, nitpicking. Overall, good work though. This is a good start for you.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay successfully addresses the topic, presenting a well-argued case for the continued importance of libraries in the age of the Internet. This careful consideration of the essay prompt and the clear expression of your viewpoints are significant strengths of your work. However, to refine your essay further and enhance your argument, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Precision in Language**: While your argument that libraries are \"irreplaceable\" is strong, it might be more accurate to describe them as \"indispensable.\" This subtle change in vocabulary more closely aligns with the idea that libraries are essential rather than being without possible alternatives. The distinction is nuanced but important for the clarity and accuracy of your argument.\n\n2. **Clarification of Concepts**: Your essay occasionally uses \"education\" and \"information\" interchangeably. It's crucial to differentiate between these terms because while libraries and the Internet are primary sources of information, education is a broader concept that encompasses the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Distinguishing between these ideas can strengthen the precision and depth of your argument.\n\n3. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Your essay demonstrates a strong command of language, which significantly aids in conveying your message. Nonetheless, there are opportunities to improve the grammatical fluency of your writing. Paying attention to sentence structure and incorporating a variety of punctuation marks beyond periods and commas can enrich your writing style and make your argument more compelling. While the minor grammatical flaws do not detract from the overall clarity of your presentation, refining these aspects can elevate the quality of your essay.\n\n4. **Argument Development**: You've done an excellent job of developing your arguments through clear, connected paragraphs. Each reason supporting your viewpoint is well-explained and contributes to a coherent overall argument. To further enhance your essay, consider expanding on how these benefits of libraries (community building and information credibility) compare to the Internet's role in information dissemination. Offering more specific examples or evidence could intensify the persuasiveness of your argument.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion effectively summarizes the essay, reinforcing the importance of libraries. For an even stronger closure, consider emphasizing the future potential of libraries in the evolving landscape of information access, tying back to your argument's main points.\n\nYour essay already stands as a robust defense of the significance of libraries. By focusing on these areas of improvement\u2014clarifying your terminology, refining your grammar and sentence structure, and deepening your argument\u2014you can elevate your essay to an even higher standard of excellence.

WHY IS IT?","essay_text":"In modern life, video games have gained much popularity among the youngsters and children thanks to its relaxation and entertainment. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, but in my personal perspective, this development can be deemed as a negative change. \\n Nowadays, many children are gluing their eyes to the screen playing games for various reasons. Video games are now becoming more and more diverse and attractive than they were in our parents' time (20-25 years ago), which draws many youngsters' attention. Indeed, gaming experience now is better for gamers. For instance, players are constantly given scores, new targets, rewards and achievements to keep them playing, which becomes an enormous temptation that users can not easily resist and it prevents them from exercising to improve their health. On top of that, to some unfortunate offspring who live in a dysfunctional family, computer games are considered a getaway from their anguish reality, deterring them from positive thinking and raising their optimistic thoughts. \\n Besides, many problems arise around spending too much time on computer-based games that cannot be forecasted and underestimated. As said before, electronic games are lures that once users are trapped in, it is extremely difficult for them to get out. Lack of sports activities and physical exercises will bring many issues to gamers. Put it differently, wasting all day looking at a computer screen leads to various acute health problems. Weak eyesight, bad posture and obesity are the best illustration for this statement. In addition, spending all day in front of electronic devices also results in children's study severely, with no time for doing homework and revisions, their further study will be ruined, which significantly affects these people's future. \\n In conclusion the rise of gaming and the decline in exercising are based on different reasons. Games can either be advantageous or not, depending on how the users utilize it.","human_feedback_text":"There is a repeated word meaning based on synonym usage in the first paragraph. Youngsters and children refer to similar age groups. since \"children'' is the keyword used in the presentation, it should not have been used in the restatement. Rather, the word youngsters alone should have been used to refer to an alternative word representation. It must also be pointed out that a \"negative change\" does not have the same meaning as a negative development: \\n Development- noun; a significant consequence or event \\n Change- verb; to transform or convert \\n The error in word usage will negatively affect the LR and GRA score. \\n The writer uses effective reasoning in the paragraphs. That is not to say that the reasons are consistently well developed because these are not. In every paragraph, the second topic always lacks in terms of a fully developed explanation. This affects the coherence and clarity of the explanation. It is always better for the final score to have a single well explained reason in a paragraph than to ruin it with a second weakly explained reason alongside it. \\n Additional deductions will apply for the sudden change in the writer's . in the concluding summary. It went from; \\n <quotation>this development can be deemed as a negative change.<\/quotation> \\n at the start to; \\n <quotation>Games can either be advantageous or not, depending on how the users utilize it.<\/quotation> \\n The discussion and opinion reference totally changed in the end.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay makes an effort to address the topic of the impact of video games on young people, arguing that the growing popularity of video games is a negative development. However, there are several areas where improvements could help strengthen the essay.\n\nFirstly, there's some confusion in word choice and redundancy, particularly in the introduction where \"youngsters\" and \"children\" are used to refer to similar age groups. It would be more effective to consistently use one term to avoid repetition. Additionally, the terms \"negative change\" and \"negative development\" are used interchangeably but don't mean the same thing. Focusing on precise language will enhance clarity and impact.\n\nThe essay presents arguments but struggles with developing them fully. Each paragraph introduces reasons why video gaming is seen negatively, yet often, the second reason provided lacks depth. An effective strategy could be to focus on elaborating one strong reason per paragraph. This will improve the coherence and strength of the arguments, making the essay's position clearer and more persuasive.\n\nThere's also an inconsistent point of view observed from the introduction to the conclusion. Initially, the essay firmly states that the popularity of video games is a negative development but concludes by suggesting that video games could have advantages or disadvantages depending on usage. This shift weakens the essay's argumentative stance. Maintaining a consistent perspective throughout would strengthen the essay's overall effectiveness.\n\nIn terms of spelling, grammar, and style, there are minor issues that impact readability. Careful proofreading and revision can address these, ensuring that the essay flows well and is free of errors.\n\nIncluding concrete examples and further elaborating on the consequences mentioned could also enrich the essay. Describing specific health issues, academic consequences, or psychological effects in more detail would make the argument more compelling.\n\nOverall, the essay tackles the prompt but would benefit from more precise word choice, better-developed arguments, consistent perspectives, and polished grammar. Focusing on one well-explained reason per paragraph and maintaining a consistent stance on video gaming's impact will greatly improve the essay's effectiveness."}

World's livestock and availability of foods would be a major breakthrough but neither safety factor nor environmentally aspect of its several products. I personally agree that the method offers several benefits to people under a certain condition. \\n Investment in science and technology has now improved modern people's quality of live. \\n The presence of transferred genes is one of the best example of this. Practically, people enjoy living under a large number of livestock owing to the fact that genetic engineering reduces time of animals and plants productivity. As seen in early twenties centuries Australia successfully gives a remedy to a problem of give-birth cows in mostly cattle farms using cloning method. Furthermore,a typical of difficult cultivation produces seedless watermelon could be a possible benefits, in addition to fulfill the huge number of market demands. However, do those product considered both healthy aspect and environmental damages in the future? \\n A majority of people come up against with healthy and environment issue.

Initially,the letter of commodity is authorized and signed up by the government within safety labels at the end. Another pivotal role is environment in which many genetic engineering may use the tremendous amount of chemical substances to fertilize the plantation. This attitude inevitably would pay substantial damages to crops on earth as the soil is no longer prolific. \\n To sum up, a debatable issue with regard to the usage of genetic engineering in technology for providing more foods may cost harmful to the world. This is because the method offers many dangerous possibilities on people's health and environment. However, government could give this technology access to people around the world safely to register a legal authorization on the product, so that the advantages remain the rest.","human_feedback_text":"Dian, the essay itself does not offer a coherent and cohesive representation of the required prompt discussion. I found myself highly confused by the overall essay because your sentence structure and grammar usage is far below the intermediate level of writing in English. The overall written work that you produced is really bad. It doesn't help to reflect your writing in the best light. Each sentence that you wrote suffers in terms of delivering a clear line of thinking or reasoning. Your ability to use English words in a manner that would provide a clear insight into your thoughts and opinions is faulty. At thing point, the confusing paragraph presentations are not the only problem of your essay. \\n The main problem that your essay has is that it does not discuss the two points of view and then a personal opinion from you. While you indicated a reference to that in your first paragraph, you did not accomplish that in the discussion paragraphs. I believe all of these problems occurred because you tried to impress the examiner with your knowledge of the topic instead of simply discussing the essay from a layman's point of view. That means, you could have used simple everyday information that is known to most people in the writing of your essay. However, you opted to sound like an authority instead by using what you hoped were impressive English words and terms which ended up backfiring because you did not know how to properly develop the discussion using the words that you decided to include in the essay. \\n Overall, I would not score this essay in order not to affect your confidence. I will tell you this however, you need to address the mistakes that I pointed out above if you hope to get a better score during your next round of practice essay writing.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay explores the topic of genetic engineering and its possible impacts on society. However, there are several areas where improvement is necessary to make your arguments clearer and more convincing. Here's a breakdown of the feedback focused on enhancing the quality of your essay:\n\n1. **Relevance to the Topic:** The essay begins with an attempt to address the topic, mentioning the debate around genetic engineering. However, it struggles to maintain a focused discussion on the topic. To improve, ensure that each paragraph directly contributes to the central argument. Introduce each viewpoint systematically before stating your personal stance clearly towards the end.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are noticeable challenges with sentence structure, grammar, and word choice that make the essay difficult to understand in parts. Simplifying your language will help significantly. Try to use shorter, clear sentences and familiar vocabulary. For example, instead of saying \"investment in science and technology has now improved modern people's quality of live,\" consider \"science and technology have improved our lives.\" This not only corrects a grammatical mistake (live should be lives) but also makes the sentence simpler and clearer.\n\n3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** While you hint at a personal opinion, it's somewhat lost in the broader discussion. To clarify your standpoint, explicitly state your position in the introduction and reiterate it in the conclusion. Use phrases like \"I believe\" or \"In my opinion\" to make your viewpoint unmistakable to the reader.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay attempts to discuss both sides and the author's view but lacks clear, supportive arguments. Each point of view should be backed by specific examples or reasoning. For instance, when mentioning the potential benefits of genetic engineering like \"seedless watermelon,\" expand on why this is beneficial, addressing concerns about health and the environment directly afterward. This will create a more balanced and persuasive argument.\n\n**General Tips for Improvement:**\n- Focus on streamlining your argument. Start by outlining the pros and cons of genetic engineering and then your personal view, supporting each with clear examples or facts.\n- Work on grammar and punctuation. Using online tools or seeking guidance can help improve these fundamental areas.\n- Avoid trying to impress with complex vocabulary or scientific terms unless you are confident in their usage. Clarity should be your priority.\n- Practice writing clear and concise sentences to convey your ideas effectively.\n\nRemember, the goal is to communicate your thoughts clearly and persuasively.

It's crucial for an essay to closely adhere to the prompt, integrating key discussion points directly related to the topic. This ensures the essay remains focused and meets the expectations set by the instructions. Consider revisiting the original prompt and weaving its essential elements more thoroughly throughout your essay with clear and direct references.\n\n2. **Use of Citations:** While incorporating perspectives like that of Santoso can enrich an essay, it's essential to present such viewpoints in a manner that is accessible to all readers, without assuming prior knowledge of the source. Consider explaining or summarizing Santoso's ideas in your own words rather than relying on direct quotes. This approach makes your argument more inclusive and understandable, ensuring a stronger connection with a broad audience.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** There are spelling and grammatical inconsistencies throughout the essay that distract from the message. Pay close attention to verb tenses, singular and plural agreements (\"advices\" should be \"advice\"), and the correct use of prepositions (\"advise to leaving\" should be \"advise leaving\").

Those experiences bring them not only keen insight of making decisions but better cognitive skills, such as big-picture thinking and long-term vision.

The high volume of work as well as the promotion of materialism could be contributing factors to this phenomenon. However, it can be tackled by such measures as the enactment of laws and shrewder financial plans. \\n To commence with, the aforementioned problem can be attributed to two reasons. One of them is the increasing number of tasks in the workplace. Since employees, in this day and age, tend to assume a heavy workload, it appears necessary to work overtime to accomplish the assigned duty, which, in the process, culminates in their reduction of time allocated into other activities. Another explanation is people pursuing materialism. To be more specific, many individuals are intrinsically inclined to acquire more material possession as a way to stay on equal footing to their friends or colleagues, resulting in their forgoing time to work harder to accumulate wealth. \\n Nonetheless, the issue could be mitigated by some viable solutions. A key of them is that national governing bodies introduce laws regulating the frequency of working overtime in every firm. For instance, any business extending their operating time over the limited days in a week have to pay the monetary fine. Additionally, each individual should build up their own shrewder financial plan. As a plethora of laborers opt for working overtime to earn a fortune due to the shortage of money, a detailed list of expenses appears efficacious now that it helps workers manage their expenditure suitably, reducing their demand to work extended hours. \\n In conclusion, the growing demands in workplace and materialistic pursuits could be the genuine cataclysms to the misbalance between work and other life aspects.

It is only after presenting the arguments from the public that you can use your personal opinion to support one of the two views in the discussion. That makes this essay a 5 paragraph comparison essay. What you wrote, based on the prompt paraphrase you created is only a 2 sided personal opinion point of view essay. That runs counter to the prompt discussion requirement. \\n The clue as to how many paragraphs should be written can be found in the discussion instruction. When it is said that you have to \"Discuss both points of view and give your opinion\", that is automatically a 5 paragraph essay. When presented with a question instruction such as \"Do you agree or disagree\", that is a 4 paragraph essay presentation. \\n The discussion requirement clearly indicates a public discussion be presented in the first 2 body paragraphs because it refers to \"Some people believe...\" which indicates a public discussion. As such, it is the reference to the public opinions that should be discussed first so that your 3rd body paragraph (4th in the overall essay paragraph presentation) that is based on your personal point of view gains strength and authority by supporting one of the two POV's.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay successfully tackles the topic of information sharing in the 21st century across various fields such as science, business, and academics. It presents a balanced view by discussing both the potential risks and benefits associated with widely sharing information, which shows an understanding of the complex nature of the issue. However, there are several areas in which this essay could be improved to meet the requirements of the topic more closely and enhance its overall clarity and persuasiveness.\n\nFirstly, the structure of the essay does not fully align with the expectations set by the prompt for a \"Discuss both points of view and give your opinion\" essay. This type of prompt generally requires a five-paragraph essay: an introduction, two paragraphs discussing the public's differing viewpoints, a third body paragraph for your own opinion, and a conclusion. This format helps in presenting a more rounded discussion before positioning your personal stance, lending it more authority and depth.\n\nRegarding spelling and grammar, the essay is relatively well-written, but attention to detail would improve its professionalism. For instance, \"21th century\" should be corrected to \"21st century\". Additionally, it's Marie Curie, not \"Cuire\". Small errors like these can distract from the message you are trying to convey.\n\nIn terms of stylistic issues, while the essay does effectively communicate its points, varying sentence structure and using more transitional phrases could make the arguments flow better and be more engaging for the reader. \n\nThe point of view of the essay author is clear, expressed with a firm stance in the conclusion. However, to make this viewpoint even stronger, it would benefit from being supported by a more structured discussion of public opinions on the topic, as highlighted by the essay's instructions. \n\nLastly, the arguments presented are relevant, but they could be more impactful with additional evidence or examples. For instance, while mentioning the positive impact of information sharing on academic performance is good, providing specific studies or statistics could substantiate this claim further.\n\nIn summary, refining the essay's structure to align with the prompt's requirements, correcting minor errors, and deepening the argumentation with more solid evidence will make the essay more compelling and robust. By focusing on these areas for improvement, the essay will better meet its objectives and more effectively communicate its message."}

To begin with, healthcare systems in this modern world are better compared to the past. It is evident that doctors and other employees in the medical field are more professionally trained before working, which means that they can find the most optimum solutions for their patients just within a short period of time instead of through trials to trials. Meanwhile, medicines and treatments for some diseases are newly proposed, which facilitate the patients' curing process. As a result, deaths from diseases will be decreased significantly and people's health will also be better, especially when they get older. Another cause is because of people's better living standards. To be more specific, technology, service and nutrition nowadays are improved to support people's lives. For example, robots are being invented to assist individuals in doing household tasks or even in their work. Therefore, people will have more time for themselves, which promotes people's mental health and their happiness index. \\n As the population's expectancy is growing, several related problems can be anticipated. Firstly, it will impose a burden on the healthcare system. To clarify this point, the elderly are more vulnerable to a number of chronic diseases. It also means that human and financial resources are required to help them with their problems, which leads to the pressure on doctors and nurses if there are more elderly. Secondly, a high proportion of the state budget will be needed for paying pensions while the number of taxpayers will decline. Younger generations work and contribute to the public budget via the tax system but as they grow older, it is clear that they cannot dedicate themselves to work anymore. As a consequence, the government will have to allocate money for them, so if the old is more than the young, it will actually be a serious issue for the community. \\n In conclusion, people living longer is because of the development in the healthcare system as well as the quality of life. However, this can put the medical professionals under pressure and impose a burden on the social budget.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>It is irrefutable<\/quotation> \\n Nobody is arguing this information with you.

Additionally, you've effectively highlighted some challenges resulting from longer life expectancies. \n\nHowever, there are several areas that could benefit from improvement to enhance the overall effectiveness of your essay. \n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: Your introduction needs a clearer thesis statement. This is where you explicitly say what your essay is going to discuss. Instead of making broad or general statements, directly mention the two factors (healthcare improvements and better living standards) and hint at the challenges these improvements bring. This provides a roadmap of your essay to the reader.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Overall, your spelling and grammar are quite good, but paying attention to smoother transitions between ideas could enhance the flow of your essay. Avoid overly complex sentences, as they can occasionally make your arguments hard to follow. Instead, focus on clear and concise statements that directly support your points.\n\n3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your point of view is reasonably clear, as you've stated the factors that contribute to increased lifespans and the resulting consequences. To strengthen your position, ensure that each paragraph clearly supports your main argument. Introducing each paragraph with a topic sentence that relates back to your thesis can achieve this clarity.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: You\u2019ve provided examples to support your reasons for the increase in life expectancy. To deepen your analysis, consider expanding on how these improvements in healthcare and living standards specifically contribute to longevity. Additionally, when discussing the challenges, offering potential solutions or discussing how societies are addressing these issues could provide a more balanced view.\n\nRemember, each paragraph should focus on a single idea supported by examples or evidence. This structure makes your arguments more persuasive and easier for the reader to follow. \n\nWhile tackling the essay's content, ensuring each paragraph aligns with your overall thesis will make your essay more cohesive and coherent. Focusing on a clear thesis statement in the introduction and reinforcing your main points in the conclusion can significantly improve the impact of your essay.\n\nLastly, engaging directly with the essay prompt in a structured manner will help you meet the requirements more effectively. Avoid unnecessary affirmations or broad statements in your introduction; instead, directly address the essay question.\n\nBy focusing on these improvements, you'll be on your way to crafting a more compelling and structured essay that not only meets but exceeds the expectations."}

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness of the argument.\n\nFirstly, the introduction of the essay does not clearly set up the topic or the stance being taken. It's crucial to start with a stronger introductory sentence that clearly states the topic and what position will be argued. This helps in immediately engaging the reader and setting the stage for the points to come.\n\nRegarding the structure and development of your points, there is a noticeable brevity in the paragraphs and the arguments presented.

For instance, \"blumia\" should be spelled as \"bulimia,\" and sentences are often missing spaces after punctuation marks. Additionally, consistent with academic writing, avoid using casual language and strive for a more formal tone.\n\nThe essay's conclusion does sum up the argument; however, like the rest of the essay, it is quite brief.

However, in some cases fast food is the main cause of many health problems. To solve this matter, governments tend to apply a higher tax on fast food. Personally, I totally agree with this statement for these following reasons. \\n It seems to me that governments should quickly establish the policy of increasing tax in fast food. The first reason behind it is that restaurants or enterprises selling fast food will have to reduce amount of this kind of food to the market. If fast food does not appear frequently on market or be sold with high price, consumers will cut off their demand for eating fast food. Therefore, people can avoid risks of getting sick from high amount of cholesterol or fat in fast food. \\n The next reason to raise the fast food tax is that the government should spend the money from tax on developing public health for the community. While we are making effort to prevent toxic factors of fast food from getting into our body, we improve the health services at the same time to offer our community sufficient access to healthcare system. It is much more beneficial for civil as their health is specially taken into account by the authorities. \\n To sum up, for a great number of people, fast food becomes a big love and eating them is hard to be a changeable habit in short time.

{"source_url":"https:\/\/essayforum.com\/writing\/knowledge-gained-experience-books-printed-79963\/","split":"train","essay_title":"Knowledge gained from personal experience or from books and other printed material; which is better?","essay_text":"Prompt: \\n compare and contrast knowledge gained from personal experience with knowledge gained from books or other printed material. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? \\n There are two main types of obtaining knowledge: by real-life experiences and through printed materials. The different ways of learning generate no shortage debate about which one is better. In my individual opinion, it is more advantages to learn directly from experiences than books. I feel this way for two major reasons, which I will explore in the following essay. \\n First of all, books are not always accurate and often contradict with what we experience from the real world. This is because a book can be written by unqualified authors and also contain their personal opinion or their biased eyes. My own experience in the US is a compelling example of this. Being a pre-immigrant to the US, I acknowledge that US citizens are not friendly and hard to have a conversation. When I moved to the US, my point-of-view change completely. Not only be generous, my neighbors are also kind and helpful. They help our family assimilate the new life and even teach us basic English statements to order food or buy groceries. Furthermore, we usually start our day with several sweet greeting. \\n Secondly, real-life experience tends to stay with us longer than printed information. Books are shelved and forgotten about shortly after we read them. Once I had an assignment about growing a little green bean tree, I collected all information from different sources including books, Internets, articles. In spite of many efforts to follow all strict rule of growing this tree, my result was not good as what I expected. Fortunately, when I consult my grandfather, he taught me a valuable lesson which I encountered in several pages of a book is that overly water or fertilize might harm the growth of the tree. What I learned from my grandfather about techniques, methods, and skills are burned into my memory and I will never forget it. This is because I had a practical experience rather than temporary theoretical information. \\n In conclusion, I strongly believe that knowledge gained from experience is more important than one from reading. This is because books are sometimes inaccurate, and we are predisposed to remember our personal memories longer.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, this being a compare and contrast essay, the approach should have been coming first from a public approach and then a personal approach, as indicated by the personal opinion instruction at the end of the original prompt.

In reality, what you wrote cannot be considered an appropriate compare and contrast essay because of the lack of proper signal phrases and transition words.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay presents a thoughtful analysis of the two primary ways of obtaining knowledge, favoring personal experience over knowledge from books.

However, the structure could be improved to more clearly delineate between comparing and contrasting, and then expressing your personal opinion. Introduce both the theoretical knowledge gained from books and the practical understanding from personal experiences at the beginning. This will set a balanced stage for comparing these sources of knowledge before stating your preference.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrases that hinder readability. For instance, \"it is more advantages\" should be \"it is more advantageous\". Also, be mindful of subject-verb agreement, as seen in \"books are not always accurate and often contradict with what we experience\". Consider revising to maintain a consistent tense and number agreement. Using simpler, clearer sentences will also make your essay more accessible to readers.\n\n3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view\u2014that personal experiences are more valuable than book knowledge\u2014is clear but could be strengthened with a clearer structure. Start by objectively discussing both sides, then introduce your personal perspective towards the end, supported by your experiences and reflections.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: Your arguments are vivid and personal, effectively illustrating your viewpoint. However, to improve, avoid listing reasons as if enumerating them. Instead, seamlessly integrate these reasons into your narrative using transition signals. Phrases like \"On one hand,... On the other hand,... Consequently,... In my experience,... This illustrates that...\" can guide your reader through your argumentation more fluidly. Remember, the use of transition signals is crucial in compare and contrast essays to lead the reader through your thought process clearly.\n\n5. **Comparative and Personal Approach**: In line with the prompt's expectation, emphasize the comparison first\u2014highlighting both the general value and limitations of books and personal experiences. Then, transition to your personal viewpoint with a clear signal, like \"Given these points,... Personally,...\". This will help structure your essay in a manner that first addresses the general perspective before delving into your personal insights.\n\nRemember, improvement comes with practice and awareness of these aspects. Focus on enhancing your essay's structure, clarity, and grammatical correctness, all while ensuring your personal voice and viewpoint remain clear and compelling.

However, ensure that you directly state your stance early in the essay without restating the prompt unnecessarily. A more streamlined introduction stating your opinion succinctly will make your argument stronger and more focused.\n\n2. **Essay Structure and Clarity**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structural organization.

A \"5 sentences per paragraph\" structure is recommended for clarity and conciseness.\n\n3. **Directness and Conciseness**: There\u2019s a tendency in your writing to include unnecessary details which can dilute the main point. Strive for directness in your language and avoid being overly verbose.

Make sure sentences are complete and ideas flow logically from one to another. Proofreading your essay for spelling and grammatical errors is also crucial.\n\n5. **Supporting Arguments**: You\u2019ve provided examples to support your viewpoint, which is excellent. To further strengthen your argument, consider including statistics or findings from credible sources whenever possible.

The introduction mixes the topic of choosing to live alone with personal opinions about marriage, which might confuse readers about the essay's main focus. A more effective strategy is to briefly introduce the topic in the opening paragraph without inserting personal opinions or starting the discussion there. Instead, clearly state what the essay will argue or describe.\n\n2. **Punctuation Usage**: Remember to use punctuation marks correctly and individually. Using two punctuation marks together (e.g., a comma followed by a period or vice versa) can confuse readers. Each punctuation mark has a distinct role in clarifying the meaning of sentences and structuring the text. Stick to one punctuation mark at a time to maintain clear and effective communication.\n\n3. **Structuring Arguments**: The essay is asked to present a viewpoint but falls into a comparative discussion, which dilutes the focus. When presenting your opinion, especially if prompted to choose a side or perspective, it\u2019s crucial to thoroughly develop arguments supporting that specific viewpoint. Adding contrary viewpoints only when necessary to acknowledge or refute counterarguments can strengthen your position without detracting from the essay's clarity and purpose.\n\n4. **Grammar and Stylistic Issues**: There are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as issues with subject-verb agreement (\"marriage and build a family are\"), misuse of articles (\"the age of overpopulation\"), and punctuation. Additionally, some sentences could be more concise to improve clarity (\"...because you can use your money more comfortable and don't have to have responsibility to spend on children, marriage, wife or husband,...\"). Working on sentence structure and grammar will significantly improve the readability of your essay.\n\n5. **Clarity of Position**: While the essay attempts to discuss the benefits of living alone, the concluding sentiment seems to shift towards a broader perspective on societal benefits, which may confuse readers about the essay's stance. Make sure your conclusion succinctly summarizes your arguments and reiterates your main point to leave a lasting impression on the reader.\n\n6. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay provides general statements about the benefits and drawbacks of living alone but lacks specific examples or evidence to back up these claims. Incorporating real-life examples, statistical data, or expert opinions can make your arguments more persuasive and engaging.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Length**: Be mindful of including irrelevant information or overly long discussions that do not contribute to your main argument. Every sentence should serve a purpose in advancing your position or providing essential context. A focused and concise essay is more effective than one that is long but off-topic.\n\nImproving these areas will not only align your essay more closely with English proficiency standards but also make your argument more persuasive and your writing clearer. Keep practicing, and consider these points in future essays to enhance your writing skills further."}

PTE academic","essay_text":"What's your opinion on getting married without worrying about getting a job \\n In the competitive world, some communities believe marriage is more vital than employment whereas others have a contrary viewpoint. This is certainly a controversial topic, considering that people look at things differently. However, it is an irrefutable fact that it is an awful idea to prioritize marriage over employment for two reasons: less time to work and lower chance of being hired. \\n To commence with, as we all know that once you are married, you will have less time for your work and subsequently, be less dedicated to your job which proves to be horrible as that means you will receive lower wages or salaries, depending on whether you are working part time or full time. This is not at all surprising, as one will need to allocate some time to look after and upbring their children. To illustrate, a friend of mine, Jessica, decided to get married before obtaining an employment and that left her with little to no time to work as her children need to be kept occupied at all times. \\n Furthermore, it is known that potential employers would prefer unmarried individuals, because those people are not distracted by family issues and therefore, can fully focus on working. This is understandable and explains the reason a number of married people cannot land their first job despite having proper qualifications. For example, one my friends complained that he was rejected for the job because he is married. \\n Having discussed the importance of obtaining employment first before getting married, it can be concluded that it is a terrible idea to prioritize marriage over employment. This results in having less time for work and being less desirable to potential employers. Consequently, I disagree with the community stating that wedding is more important than occupation.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, your presentation is not coming from a general point of view. You are thinking about the disadvantages of marriage for women, rather than the disadvantage of men and women being married prior to entering the workplace. The prompt is asking you to consider the situation coming, not from a gender point of view but rather, an age related point of view. For example, how does being married young affect the ability of a young couple to find a job. If say, a couple married while in college and then started a family right away. How does that affect their ability to get a job in the future? Consider cultures that advocate for young marriage such as the Chinese and Asian Indians among others. Are there any advantages to being married prior to being employed for both men and women based on a cultural context? That is the main consideration of the essay. It isn't about gender, which is what your statement implies. More importantly, the actual discussion asks you whether you think it is right to marry when one is not yet employed. While your discussion is correct to a certain degree, the problem with it is that you focused on the gender side of the issue instead of the general facts and opinions regarding the discussion.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay tackles a thought-provoking topic: the decision to marry before securing employment. Overall, the points made are coherent and articulate a clear stance against prioritizing marriage over employment. However, there are several areas where this essay could be improved to fully address the prompt and provide a more balanced analysis.\n\n1. **Alignment with the Topic:** The essay interprets the question through a narrow lens, focusing on challenges primarily related to women and overlooking the broader implications for both partners in a marriage. The prompt encourages a discussion on the effects of early marriage on the employability of young couples, irrespective of gender. Expanding the perspective to include both men and women, and considering cultural practices that encourage young marriages, could offer a richer analysis. Reflecting on whether there might be any advantages or benefits, alongside the disadvantages, would also provide a more balanced argument.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** The essay is generally well-written but could benefit from closer attention to grammatical consistency and choice of wording. For example, consider revising repetitive phrases and ensuring pronoun usage accurately reflects the subjects being discussed. Simplifying complex sentences could improve clarity and make the essay more accessible to all readers.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** The essay successfully conveys a clear opinion against prioritizing marriage before employment, attributed to the potential challenges in balancing work and family life, and the perceived disadvantages in job hunting. However, elaborating on this viewpoint with a broader consideration of societal, cultural, and economic factors could deepen the discussion.\n\n4. **Arguments and Supports:** The essay provides examples to support its stance but leans heavily on personal anecdotes, which may not fully represent broader experiences or varying cultural contexts. Incorporating statistical data, research findings, or a wider range of real-world scenarios could strengthen the argument. Additionally, exploring potential counterarguments\u2014such as situations where being married could be advantageous in job hunting, or cultural contexts where early marriage is the norm\u2014would offer a more nuanced perspective.\n\nImproving these elements would not only address the prompt more directly but also enhance the essay's overall depth, making for a compelling and well-rounded argument. Remember, the goal is to engage with the topic in a way that considers all relevant perspectives, providing a balanced and informative discussion."}

However, there are several areas where improvements can aid in clarifying your message and aligning your writing with academic standards. Below are specific suggestions to enhance your essay:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Genre**: Your enthusiasm for BL (Boy Love) movies is evident, but considering not all readers may be familiar with this category, it would be beneficial to begin your essay with a brief introduction to BL films. Explain what characterizes a BL movie and why \"Thien Quan Tu Phuc\" is significant within this genre.

For clarity, please specify whether the story is contained within a single film or if it extends over multiple installments. This distinction will help readers understand the scope of the narrative you\u2019re discussing.\n\n3. **Adherence to Academic Standards**: The overall presentation of your essay leans more towards an informal blog post than academic writing. To align your work with academic expectations, consider adopting a more formal tone. This can involve avoiding casual language, focusing on clear and structured arguments, and providing evidence to support your points (e.g., examples of the deep meanings or character development you mentioned).\n\n4. **Addressing the Essay Topic**: Ensure your essay directly responds to the given topic. If the prompt asks for an analysis of a movie's impact or its thematic depth, make sure your discussion centers on these aspects rather than a summary of the plot.\n\n5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are occasional spelling and grammatical errors in your essay. Proofreading your work or using a spelling and grammar check tool can help eliminate these mistakes. Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure to create a more engaging and dynamic read.\n\n6. **Point of View and Arguments**: Your perspective as a fan of the movie is clear, but your essay would benefit from more detailed arguments supporting your viewpoint. Discuss specific aspects of the movie\u2014such as character development, cinematography, or how certain themes are explored\u2014to substantiate your positive assessment of the film.\n\n7. **Descriptive Language**: You've made a commendable effort to express your admiration for the movie's details and emotional depth. Enhancing your essay with more descriptive language about these elements can further communicate their impact to the reader. For example, instead of stating the movie has a \"smooth emotional circuit,\" describe how the filmmakers achieve this through their narrative techniques or character interactions.\n\nRemember, the goal of an academic essay is not only to share your enthusiasm for a subject but to analyze and persuade through structured, evidence-backed argumentation.

What books are to scholars, instruments are to musicians, parents are always behind the children, and the influence they bring is the same, which is along with the whole lifetime of children. What parents do, even on a tiny thing, could leave deep impressions on the children's mind. For example, If the parents are not mentally healthy, it is very possible for the children to suffer from the mental illness in the future. Therefore, parents should often watch out their behaviors to be equal to a \"teacher\" and keep in mind that a best teacher is able to cultivate children through their daily life. \\n What's more, family education lends itself to direct and stimulate children's interest.

Personally, I am in agreement with the latter view, even though the other one also shows some obvious advantageous points. \\n The option to not become the host of the sporting events is attractive for several reasons. Regarding the economy, countries which organize the international events such as Olympics, FIFA World Cup have to pay a huge sum of money for building new or renovating existing sports facilities. Consequently, such investments probably make some fields of daily life, especially education, hospital system and healthcare suffer from a heavy burden because of the lack of funds. Another issue is that foreign people flocking to the host country are likely to negatively impact on the society. Some criminals and terrorists can take advantage of the massive movement, the crowd and sporting matches for illegal purposes. \\n However, I believe it is more beneficial to be the place where sports tournaments are organized. One of the evident advantages is that when a world-class event is held in a country, it will build the reputation and dignity, which increases the profile of tourism and even politics. For instance, in 2018, Russia, which was the host of FIFA World Cup, was always splashed in headlines across all the newspapers, websites and also visited by millions of tourists. As a result, Russia's economy was boosted strongly and it has been a popular tourist destination until now.

This approach prevents confusion and sets a clear stage for the rest of the essay. Remember, the thesis statement shouldn't overstate your position in \"agree or disagree\" prompts; a simple agreement or disagreement suffices.\n\n**2. Essay Structure:**\nThe essay would benefit significantly from adhering to the conventional five-paragraph structure - one introductory paragraph, three body paragraphs discussing different aspects of your argument, and a concluding paragraph. This structure helps in organizing your essay more logically and in ensuring all essential elements are covered comprehensively.\n\n**3. Clarity and Cohesion:**\nThere was some confusion in following your arguments, particularly because the reasons behind your viewpoint and the examples provided were not always clearly connected or explained. A clearer structure where each body paragraph discusses a single reason for your stance, followed by specific examples or further explanations, would enhance understanding and flow. Additionally, separating your discussion points as suggested\u2014your reasons for agreeing with people moving abroad for work, understanding it as a natural process, and elaborating on personal or observed experiences\u2014will not only clarify your arguments but also showcase your ability to organize and present thoughts cohesively.\n\n**4. Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**\nWhile minor, there are a few spelling and grammatical errors in your essay. Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure and utilizing a wider range of vocabulary to make your writing more engaging and to demonstrate your language proficiency. Paying attention to the precision of language and correcting errors will improve the readability and professionalism of your essay.\n\n**5. Using Examples:**\nYour example involving a colleague named Mary illustrates your point but could be made more impactful by explicitly connecting it back to your argument. Make sure that when you provide examples, they directly support your claims and the connection to your overall argument is clear.\n\nIn summary, focusing on organizing your essay into the five-paragraph format, clarifying your arguments with distinct reasons and examples in separate paragraphs, and improving the introductory and concluding paragraphs will significantly enhance your essay. Addressing these suggestions will not only make your essay more coherent and easier to follow but also better showcase your language proficiency and argumentative skills."}

Even though I perceive that the trend is conducive, I would concede that the drawbacks are also considerable. \\n Firstly, it is incontrovertible that distance learning and telecommuting offer people a flexible schedule and work-life balance. Consequently, not only can students and employees easily take a break whenever their brains reach a saturation point but they can also spend quality time with their families. Neuroscientists at Harvard University have proved that this can boost productivity by 35% since their brains are adequately supplied with positive neurotransmitters, guaranteeing well-being and eventually, satisfying academic outcomes and great company's projects. Indeed, in 2018, 65% of disciplined remote workers of Facebook reported performing astonishingly more effectively than they would have done if they had been framed in an office space. \\n On the other hand, despite all of the benefits, studying or working from home requires great discipline. Although technological breakthroughs allow for unprecedented convenience, they are often accompanied by many distractions such as social media and online games. For many people, not until they finish the latest episode of Itaewon class on Netflix or a League of Legends match can they start to work or study seriously. Besides, many studies from Oxford University have proved that even when they are working, their attention can also be split between distractions and duties, leading to worse performance. Therefore, never should anyone choose to work from home unless they are mentally strong. \\n To recapitulate, opting to work or study from home is double-edged, depending on the attitude of each person. If they can reject Internet temptation, distance-learning or telecommuting is a great opportunity and vice versa","human_feedback_text":"Don't you find it difficult to write an essay that does not take a solid stance on the given topic? I am just wondering about that because, aside from the fact that not having a solid opinion on the topic, when one is required will automatically get you a TA score of 2, it is also difficult to discuss 2 different topics within 2 reasoning paragraphs in this essay. It is difficult to score highly in the cohesiveness and coherence section when you are discussing 2 unrelated paragraphs in a 4 paragraph essay. Unless the essay is clearly an A\/D or 2 opinion with personal point of view essay, you do not need to take a non-stance in the discussion presentation. The requirement is one opinion, properly supported in 2 reasoning paragraphs. It is never a comparison essay discussion. \\n Your essay will not score well because you did not properly respond to the prompt requirement. The discussion format is incorrect in the reasoning paragraphs. You are not saying that you believe this is a positive development. Neither are you saying that this is a negative development. What you are saying is that the topic is both a positive and negative development. Your response is a maybe. You cannot use maybe as a reason because you only have Yes or No to choose from, positive or negative. That is what the examiner will expect you to respond with in your prompt paraphrase. As such, your essay is inconclusive in terms of discussion and, due to the other existing grammar and punctuation problems, will have a difficulty in achieving a passing band score.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay provides a balanced view on the topic of working and studying from home, highlighting both its advantages and disadvantages. However, it's crucial to take a definitive stance when the prompt requires it. Instead of presenting a balanced perspective, choosing either a positive or negative position and supporting it thoroughly would more effectively meet the expectations of the essay task. Here are some specific points to consider for improvement:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay somewhat fails to directly answer the prompt because it discusses both the positive and negative aspects equally. For proficiency tests, it's often required to take a clear stance. Make sure to clearly argue in favor of one viewpoint throughout the essay.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay is generally well-written but watch out for complex sentences that may introduce subtle grammatical errors or make the essay harder to follow. Simplify where possible while retaining the essence of the argument. Remember, clarity and correctness are key.\n\n3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay's perspective, which tries to capture both sides of the argument, can make your main point less clear. Deciding on a single stance and presenting it unequivocally from the beginning will help in making your point of view unmistakable.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: While the essay does an excellent job of providing evidence and examples to back up its points, focusing on one side of the argument would allow for deeper analysis and stronger support for your stance. Make sure every argument directly supports the position you've chosen, and relates back to the thesis statement.\n\nTo strengthen your essay:\n\n- Begin by clearly stating your viewpoint in the introduction. Whether you believe studying or working from home is beneficial or not, make that stance evident.\n- In the body paragraphs, concentrate on developing arguments that support this viewpoint. Rather than discussing the opposite perspective, use both paragraphs to delve deeper into your chosen stance with detailed examples and explanations.\n- Ensure all examples are directly relevant to your argument. If discussing the benefits, tie every piece of evidence back to why it supports your positive perspective, and vice versa if you're focusing on drawbacks.\n- Conclude by reiterating your viewpoint and summarizing the key supporting arguments. Avoid introducing new examples or perspectives here.\n\nImproving these areas will not only make your essay more coherent but also ensure it meets the criteria for a higher mark on English proficiency tests."}

There are a number of reasons for this trend, and in my opinion young people should be fostered to work in agriculture. \\n There are two important reasons why so few young people choose to do farming work. Firstly, In the view point of most young people, farming jobs are associated with hard work and poverty. Farming work requires people to do manual labor for a long time to take care of the plants. Moreover, if the Weather conditions are not favorable on those is a serious disaster such as a flood, the farmer will be likely suffer heavy losses. Secondly, with the development of the national economy and technology, farmers is no longer a remarkable career choice. Nowadays, young people have a lot of career choices that are less hard, earn more and more stable than farming. In particular, the younger generation now enjoys a full education and they always aiming for mental labor jobs. \\n However, I think it is essential to encourage young people to do farming work because of two main reasons. The main one is to keep the farming industry alive. In some agricultural countries, for example Vietnam, the agriculture plays an role in the national economy, not only to supply to people in the country, but also to export abroad. The survival of agriculture is very important in such countries, so it is necessary to encourage the young to work in this field to ensure its existence. Furthermore today's young generation enjoy a full education, so they have broad knowledge and understanding, which help them to have useful initiatives for the agricultural industry. They can invent and use modern technologies for farming, which can help increase work efficiency and avoid many risks. \\n In conclusion, there are some clear reasons for young people not to choose a job in agriculture, and I think it is necessary to encourage them to do farming work.","human_feedback_text":"An accurate prompt topic restatement will not include the writer's opinion as to whether or not the proposed topic is true or false.

However, there are several areas that require attention and improvement to enhance the overall clarity, coherence, and quality of your work.\n\n1. **Topic Response & Thesis Statement**: Initially, your essay appears to partially diverge from the best practices for restating the topic. When introducing the subject, it's preferable to rephrase the given prompt without inserting your personal opinion or additional commentary not present in the original statement. Moreover, your thesis could be more comprehensive by directly addressing all parts of the prompt. This means clearly stating your position and briefly outlining your reasons, which will provide a stronger foundation for your argument and satisfy the essay requirements more effectively.\n\n2. **Language and Grammar**: Your understanding of the topic shines through, but the essay is hindered by several grammatical issues, notably with singular versus plural nouns and some inappropriate capitalization. These mistakes could distract readers and impact your essay's professionalism. To improve, pay careful attention to subject-verb agreement and reserve capital letters for proper nouns or the beginning of sentences. Simplifying complex ideas into shorter, more direct sentences can also help reduce grammatical errors.\n\n3. **Redundancy**: There's noticeable redundancy in how you introduce the reasons in both sections of your essay \u2014 labeling them as \"two important reasons\" and \"two main reasons.\" Such repetition can impact the reader's engagement and affect the essay's overall score. Aim to diversify your language by finding alternative ways to introduce your arguments or by varying your sentence structures.\n\n4. **Consistency in Argumentation**: Towards the conclusion, your tone shifts from a strong conviction to a more uncertain stance. This inconsistency can confuse readers about your position and weaken the persuasive power of your essay. Maintain a consistent tone throughout your essay to reinforce your arguments and demonstrate confidence in your viewpoints.\n\n5. **Enhancements to Arguments**: While your arguments are clear and relevant, they could benefit from deeper development and more specific examples. Particularly when advocating for youth engagement in agriculture, consider incorporating statistics, studies, or concrete examples that illustrate successful integration of technology in farming or highlight the benefits of young people's involvement in agriculture. This will make your case more compelling and grounded in evidence.\n\nIn summary, focusing on these areas for improvement will not only make your essay more engaging and easier to follow but also enhance the overall persuasiveness of your argument.

Despite the evident disadvantages, I'm of the opinion that these are outmatched by the advantages. \\n On the one side, the increasing percentage of younger individuals augments the pressure on various aspects of society such as healthcare, education, housing etc., thus accelerates the exhaustion of resources. With a high percentage of young population, some nations are currently struggling with a low employment rate due to the incompetence of providing sufficient jobs. \\n On the other side, I'm completely convinced that such drawbacks can be compensated by the significant benefits that could be extracted from a population dominated by young adults. One reason for this affirmation is that younger generation represents a youthful and abundant labor force capable of undertaking a wide range of occupations that require both intellectual and physical strengths. Another reason is that a growing number of young people can be attributed to a booming consumer market, thereby contributes to boosting the expansion of production and the overall socio-economic development. In addition, workforce predominantly made up by young population is usually considered a magnet attracting large volume of foreign direct investment. A shining example of this is Vietnam, a South East Asian country which has consistently been a major labor export market thanks to a high proportion of young population registered over the years. \\n To summarize, it appears to me that in some countries, the prevalence of the younger generation in relation to older adults is more beneficial than harmful.","human_feedback_text":"Your first reasoning paragraph is not thoroughly developed.

Development of Arguments: The first area needing attention is the development of the initial argument. The essay suggests that a youthful demographic places pressure on resources like healthcare, education, and housing, but this idea isn't explored in depth.

Clarity and Coherence: Lastly, to further improve clarity and coherence, transitioning smoothly between paragraphs and within arguments would enhance the readability of the essay. Clear transition sentences could serve to better connect ideas and arguments, ensuring a logical flow throughout.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on fully developing each argument, expanding the conclusion to meet structural guidelines, careful proofreading for language accuracy, and enhancing clarity and coherence are key areas for improvement.

Prestigious academics recognized the talent and effort that artists have. For example, Academic awards like Oscar hosts every year in the United Stat and have an enormous audience around the world. Another reason would be the salary. Talented people deserve earn a good salary this is depend on their popularity and talent. A good actor can make a lot of money just for only one movie.

In my opinion, I believe these two sides have their strengths and drawbacks. \\n On the one hand, the nation and its people can gain significant benefits from those earning an excessive amount of money. Firstly, the higher salaries individuals earn, the more personal income tax they pay to the government's budget, which will be expended for public facilities and services. Additionally, many rich people often spend their property for charitable activities such as donations, building schools for orphans, helping the homeless and people with difficult circumstances, and so on. More importantly, these high-income people earn their livings, which also benefit the others, mostly by their ability as well as time and endeavor they have spent that may be far more than the rest, which makes it justifiable for them to make such a profit. Thus, it is reasonable for the government to support a few people to keep earning high salaries to some extent. \\n On the other hand, individuals with extremely high incomes in comparison with the others have brought about some significant social issues, particularly the inequality gap between rich and poor. With a large amount of money, the rich have more means to earn more such as investment, relationships, and so on, whereas the poor have lesser and lesser ways to make a living. As a result, the rich get richer, and the poor is poorer, leading to social conflicts, even violent activities.

Consequently, there have been many protests, including violent ones, as well as robberies and even suicides. Therefore, it is urgent for the government to adjust the policy to reduce the gap, probably by controlling the amount one can earn. \\n In conclusion, I believe people have their justification for their high salaries to some length, but it will bring not only benefits but also problems to the community.

Apparently, it appears to have a lot of advantages which are completely superior to those of humans, but everything has its drawbacks and technology is not an exception. \\n Firstly, it cannot be denied that technology is becoming more important in life. This is because of the fact that technology can now help people do many things which they may do not have time to do or they do not have the ability to do it as accurately and well as it does. .. For example, over the years, people are increasingly having some automatic machines in their houses like cleaning machine in order to mop and sweep their floors, for they are too busy with their work. Moreover, technology can also be applied in entertainment industry that people are manipulating it to create games with fascinating virtual worlds or cartoons with beautiful graphics for relaxation purposes Furthermore, in factories, hi-tech machines can even replace humans in several stages of producing process to improve efficiency because its accuracy is better than their, and using it is much cheaper than hiring employees to do. \\n However,if we overuse technology, it can lead to negative results. With its convenience, people are likely to depend on machines; therefore, they gradually lose their ability to do even easy housework on their own. Besides, there is a more serious problem which is unemployment. With the ability to replace humans in work activities, this will probably make a large number of people unemployed, causing unstable politics and vices. For example, if people don't have a job to earn money for life, they may commit some illegal acts like stealing or robbing. \\n In conclusion,in my opinion, despite all the disadvantages, technology's strengths are more significant. Though, people should find out how to use it properly.","human_feedback_text":"Even though you successfully wrote more than 300 words, the essay itself is empty of useful reasoning and convincing facts. You have not been able to convince the examiner that you have useful knowledge of the topic provided. The discussion, though in English, lacks proper context and therefore, greatly suffers in terms of Coherence and Cohesiveness. The discussion appears to go around in circles, without a convincing aspect. It is not that you do not have enough of an English vocabulary to pass the test, it is that you do not show that you have enough logic and reasoning to back up the vocabulary you are using. There is a need for you to create a more interesting and informative paragraph presentation.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay addresses the topic about the impact of technology on our lives, mentioning both its advantages and disadvantages. However, to improve the essay, a more in-depth analysis and clear, supportive arguments would enhance the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the points being made.\n\n1. **Response to Topic**: The essay does engage with the topic, but it lacks a strong position or a clear thesis statement that guides the reader through the arguments. Consider starting the essay by clearly stating your viewpoint regarding the impact of technology on human life. This will help make the essay more focused and the arguments more compelling.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: There are minor grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing throughout the essay. Pay attention to verb tenses, a more varied vocabulary, and sentence structure to improve clarity and flow. Avoid repetitions and ensure pronoun-antecedent agreement ('its accuracy is better than their' should be 'its accuracy is better than theirs').\n\n3. **Point of View Clarity**: Although the essay presents a viewpoint that technology's advantages outweigh its disadvantages, this perspective needs to be stated more clearly and strongly at the beginning. Make your thesis statement definitive and use the body paragraphs to reinforce it by presenting clear and logical arguments.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay tends to mention general observations rather than providing specific examples or evidence to support the claims. To strengthen the essay, incorporate real-life examples, factual evidence, or statistical data that underscore the benefits and drawbacks of technology. Also, dive deeper into analyzing how technology affects individuals and society instead of just stating the obvious. For instance, discussing the psychological implications of dependency on technology or providing studies\/statistics on unemployment due to automation will make your arguments more persuasive.\n\nLastly, the essay would benefit from a more structured approach, including an introduction with a thesis statement, body paragraphs each discussing a clear point with support, and a conclusion summarizing the essay's main points and restating the position. Crafting an essay with these elements in mind will make your writing more interesting, informative, and convincing.\n\nRemember, the goal is to clearly express your thoughts and reasoning in a way that engages the reader and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. With practice and attention to these details, your essays will become more coherent, cohesive, and compelling."}

While nobody can deny the negative affect it brings to us, however, I complete agree that work and study from home is a positive development. \\n There are two main reasons why many people think it is a negative development. One reason is that we can lose focus from our work. For example, if you are a student and you are writing the essay for your study, the notifications from the social media will distract you from writing your essay. Furthermore, you can immerse yourself in the virtual life and it will have many serious consequences like you will not spend your time for your family or you will isolate yourself from everyone around you. \\n Apart from the practical negative points expressed above, I believe that work and study from home is a positive development. Firstly, in the period of the outbreak of Covid-19, work and study from home is very important. If you do not accept the government regulations of social-distancing, it will be dangerous for you and the people around. Secondly, work and study from home can make us feel more comfortable when we work or study.

The essay should focus on presenting clear arguments related to the statement without making broad claims about its truth or universality.

Therefore, the norms of lifestyles, attitudes or behaviors in the gone-by days are thought to be incompatible with youngsters in this modern world. Personally, I am in favor of the above statement as the reasons following. \\n To begin with, on the grounds of the strong transformation of society, some outmoded customs have gradually lost their relevance in the life of young generation. In fact, the world is ever-changing in every aspect of life leading to enormous differences in social viewpoints in each era. Accordingly, numerous prejudices of the elderly are now considered irrational. For example, decades ago, the majority of individuals had a strong aversion to and even vehemently opposed the LGBT+ community or hobbies such as tattoo and piercing. However, nowadays, these topics are commonly seen as normal thanks to the growing priority of human rights and cultural interference. \\n With respect to career, the young can hardly succeed if only traditional methods are applied. Indeed, before the advances of technology and automation, when most tasks were done laboriously, hard work was highly valued. Nevertheless, in the context of digital era, the keys to success such as diligence of predecessors become outdated. Instead, proactiveness and independence or skills namely computer skills or organizational skills, which were previously overlooked by older generations, are now regarded as factors in achievements. \\n In conclusion, for the aforementioned reasons, I hold a firm belief that old ideas on mindset or behaviors are not helpful in preparing the new generation to face a modenizing world in most of the cases. Alternatively, the young should get ready to embrace the changes of the new era.

It is important that you refer to the correct response format in the first paragraph because you are being scored in the accuracy of your response.

You present clear arguments that align with your viewpoint, demonstrating an understanding of the subject matter. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and adherence to the essay prompt requirements.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: The initial introduction of your position, \"Personally, I am in favor of the above statement,\" lacks specificity regarding the extent of your agreement. The prompt appears to ask for a nuanced response (\"To what extent...?\"), which requires you to clarify how strongly you agree or disagree from the outset. Begin by clearly stating your stance and the degree of your agreement in the introduction to make your position immediately clear to the readers.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Your essay is well-written with few grammatical errors, showing a good command of the English language. However, enhancing the variety of sentence structures could improve readability and engagement. For example, starting sentences with different phrases or clauses might make the text more dynamic. Also, be cautious with words that may have subtle differences in meaning or usage to ensure precise communication of your ideas.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your viewpoint is clearly expressed throughout the essay; however, reinforcing this with specific, illustrative examples would strengthen your arguments further. It's beneficial to explicitly tie each example back to your central thesis to remind readers of how each point supports your overarching stance.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: You\u2019ve identified relevant and compelling arguments to support your views, such as the shifting societal perceptions towards the LGBT+ community and changing career skills due to technological advances. To elevate your essay, ensure that your conclusion succinctly reiterates these key points. The phrase \"for the aforementioned reasons\" should lead into a brief recap of these reasons in the conclusion, not merely signal that reasons have been provided earlier. Including concise summaries of your main arguments in the conclusion helps reinforce your position and ensures the essay feels complete and cohesive.\n\nOverall, your essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic with compelling arguments. Incorporating the above feedback can further refine your essay, making your arguments more impactful and ensuring alignment with the essay prompt's requirements for a more effective and persuasive piece.

While we could not deny the fact that this trend can reap insurmountable economic benefits, it is believed to have an overwhelming detrimental impact on the environment, not to mention the unemployment rate. \\n To begin with, although online shopping per se has several so-called multifold advantages, its significant downsides to the environment cannot be excluded. With the spiraling of purchasing on the web, there exists a dire need for packaging materials to courier their goods. Therefore, a surge in plastic and paper usage for fulling such online orders is undoubtedly inevitable. This would negatively affect the green cover of the Earth with mounting wastes strewing all over, leading to several catastrophic environmental phenomena in the foreseeable future. \\n Secondly, local shops which used to be the main supplies of goods, now facing a probability of shutting down their outlets. This is because the advent of online shopping enables customers to have infinite choices, which available in even inaccessible locations, whereas the traditional could only provide them limited products. Moreover, this superefficient shopping habit guaranteed that clienteles would own a similar quality product with lower prices in comparision with local goods, leading to numerous salesmen being unemployed and having to fight to justify their relevance in this hypermodern and advanced technological era. \\n From the arguments given, I firmly believe that online shopping has a damaging effect on our planet along with the financial aspects of several employees and employers. Given the odd nature of our contemporary affair, we will have to create an ad hoc committee to propose solutions to the problem.","human_feedback_text":"This essay will be deemed only partially responsive to the task. That is because this 4 paragraph essay is missing the loss of job discussion paragraph. The format is: \\n - Paraphrase \\n - Environmental impact \\n - Loss of jobs \\n - Concluding summary \\n Your essay focused only the environmental aspect. You only mentioned the loss of jobs, without a discussion in the concluding part, which, by the way, doesn't follow the proper format for a concluding paragraph. So, without the concluding paragraph, the essay will be deemed to be open ended, which means you will lose considerable points due to 2 avoidable errors in the discussion presentation. \\n Try to use topic sentences to kick off your paragraphs. Your presentations tend to be very long winded and almost senseless because you spend all the time introducing the topic instead of discussing the topic sentence reasons in the paragraph. Don't focus on just the vocabulary and word count, focus on the quality of the content and clarity of your explanation instead. One topic sentence = 4 justification sentences. That means a total of 5 related sentences in every paragraph.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay on the impact of online shopping on the environment and job losses provides a good foundation for discussion but needs a few adjustments to fully respond to the assignment. Let\u2019s break down how you can improve:\n\n1. **Responde to the Topic Fully**: The essay does address the environmental impact of online shopping, which is great. However, it only briefly mentions the job losses without fully exploring this topic, especially in the concluding part. Remember, a well-rounded essay should cover all aspects of the given prompt. Consider adding a dedicated paragraph that discusses the implications of online shopping on employment in more detail, and then recap this discussion in your conclusion.\n\n2. **Structure and Paragraphing**: Your essay's format has potential but can be fine-tuned for better clarity. Ideally, an essay should have a clear structure: an introduction that paraphrases the question, followed by body paragraphs that each address a specific point (in this case, one on environmental impact and another on job losses), and a concluding summary that wraps up your argument. Ensure your concluding paragraph neatly summarizes your main points without introducing new information. Adding topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph will help clarify your main points right from the start.\n\n3. **Conciseness and Clarity**: While your vocabulary is impressive, the essay sometimes becomes hard to follow due to lengthy sentences and complex language. Aim for conciseness and clarity in your writing. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence followed by several sentences that justify or explain this point, ideally sticking to one main idea per paragraph. This will make your essay more coherent and easier to understand.\n\n4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: You have a good command of language, but watch for occasional spelling, grammar, or stylistic issues. For instance, \u201cfulling\u201d should be \u201cfulfilling\u201d, and watch out for phrases that might be overly complicated or unclear. Simplifying your language slightly will help make your arguments more accessible.\n\n5. **Clear Point of View**: Your viewpoint on the negative impacts of online shopping is clear, which is good. Enhance your essay by providing more specific examples and evidence to support your arguments, especially regarding how online shopping affects employment. These examples will make your position stronger and more persuasive.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully addressing both the environmental and employment aspects mentioned in the prompt, structure your essay with clear topic sentences, and aim for clarity in your writing. With these adjustments, your essay will be much stronger and more effective in communicating your arguments."}

This essay will discuss both points of view before coming to a reasoned conclusion. \\n On the one hand, there are several reasons why protecting animals from killing them for daily products is a considerable choice. First, many scientific shreds of evidence show that consuming an excessive amount of meat on a regular and long-term basis may cause health problems, including cancer and heart disease. Instead, vegetarian diets that are proved to provide the same amount of nutrients for consumers are becoming the best selection. Moreover, thousands of wild animals like tigers and rhinos are killed each year; their fur, bones, and horns are taken for medicine and the fashion industry. However, there is no endorsement that these products are available for curing diseases. Therefore, it is such an inhuman action that should be restricted by the government. \\n Despite the above arguments, I believe that animals' products are vital for human life that could not be altered immediately. Food products from animals are necessary for the human to meet the demand of nutrition which in vegetarian foods do not contain. Besides, some people who are into meat need this type of protein to be satisfied and enjoy their lives in some ways. Another reason is that medical experiments on people are considered to be so risky that we need animals like white mice to use as substitutes. As a result, these animals desire their lives for science instead of having meaningless ones and humans could limit the damages in many lab experiments. \\n In conclusion, the use of animals to provide food, medicine, and clothing is essential to satisfy our various needs. However, consumption must be strictly controlled and used for advantageous purposes.","human_feedback_text":"Your prompt paraphrase is confusing as the details from the original prompt have not been separated in your presentation. Use 3 sentences to separate the information then 2 sentences in the same paragrapg to opine the discussion points. \\n You have also misrepresented the discussion instructions. You are not being asked to present a conclusion regarding the given topic. Instead, you are directed to offer a personal opinion. An opinion is only a point of view or your thoughts about the topic.

However, there are several areas where improvements can significantly enhance your essay's clarity, effectiveness, and adherence to the assigned task.\n\n1. **Response to Topic**: It's crucial to distinguish the information provided in the prompt clearly. Your introduction should ideally begin by paraphrasing the prompt in a clear, concise manner. This entails using about three sentences to separate and articulate the information provided by the prompt and then adding two sentences where you succinctly state your opinion on the topic. A clear distinction between your thoughts and the discussion points ensures you are directly responding to the essay's prompt.\n\n2. **Providing an Opinion vs. Conclusion**: There seems to be a misunderstanding in your essay regarding the difference between presenting a personal opinion and drawing a conclusion. The task asks for your viewpoint or what you think about the issue, not a definitive conclusion to the debate. Adjusting your approach to focus more on sharing your perspective can help align your essay closer to the task's requirements.\n\n3. **Essay Structure and Argumentation**: Your essay's structure would benefit from more distinct separation between different viewpoints and your personal opinion. Presenting each argument in separate paragraphs helps to maintain clarity and aids the reader in understanding different perspectives. After exploring these perspectives, offer your informed opinion, considering the comparison of both sides. This structure supports a discussion that feels complete and thoroughly explored.\n\n4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Pay closer attention to your grammar and spelling to enhance the readability of your essay. While your essay communicates clear ideas, smoother sentence structure and correct grammar usage can significantly impact your essay's professionalism and clarity.\n\n5. **Clarity of Author's Point of View**: Your essay touches on both sides of the argument but leans towards a specific perspective. Ensure that your point of view is distinctly expressed, providing clear and descriptive arguments to support your stance. Readers should be able to understand your position without confusion.\n\n6. **Use of Evidence and Examples**: You've made a good effort to include examples and evidence to support your points. Continuously strive to integrate relevant, clear examples that reinforce your arguments. This not only strengthens your position but also demonstrates critical thinking skills.\n\nRevising your essay with these points in mind can greatly improve its organization, coherence, and alignment with the essay prompt.

In other words, it is easier to keep up your allowance when visiting new places independently on the ground that traveller can decide for themself what to spend money on. Another reason why people are inclined to travel individually is boosting their confidence. Being on their road will help them to achieve valuable life skills, challenge their limits and ability to deal with obstacles. As a result, it turns them into a more confident person. Moreover, being a solo traveller make it much easier to interact with the locals. Therefore, you can embrace more chances to make more friends. \\n There are some drawbacks of travelling alone that also need to be taken into account. First and foremost, personal safety could be a serious concern. One clear evidence is that when people travel individually, there is no one to watch their back. For example, it is much safer for people to get back to the hotel late at night when travelling with other person. Another major issue is that you will feel lonely when travelling alone. In other words, you will not be able to share the moment, for instance, there you are, stunned by a perfect panorama or a sensational skyline and there is no one to discuss just how wonderful it is but instead, you take a few pictures and leave. \\n In conclusion, although travelling solo has certain negative effects such as personal safety concern and feeling of loneliness, it has an extremely positive influence on people budget and confidence.","human_feedback_text":"Basically, your essay did not follow the original prompt at all.

The task was to discuss the perspectives of traveling alone versus traveling with companions, including your own viewpoint on the matter. The essay predominantly focused on solo travel, comparing its pros and cons, rather than contrasting solo and group travel experiences.

For example, phrases like \"somewhat related to low budget\" might be clearer as \"related to a lower budget.\" Additionally, consistency in perspective (switching between \"traveler\" and \"you\") can help maintain focus and readability.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Author\u2019s Point of View**: Your personal opinion is evident towards the conclusion, stating a preference towards the advantages of solo travel despite its drawbacks. However, integrating this viewpoint more explicitly throughout the essay with phrases such as \"In my view\" or \"I believe\" could make your position clearer. Additionally, balancing your opinion with consideration of the opposite perspective (traveling with companions) as per the prompt would strengthen your argument.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay effectively outlines several credible arguments for and against solo travel, such as budget flexibility and the potential for loneliness. These points are well-explained, with examples that support your view. However, to fully meet the prompt's requirements, consider also discussing the benefits and disadvantages of traveling with others. This approach would provide a more comprehensive analysis and demonstrate a broader understanding of the topic.\n\nTo improve further, consider re-structuring the essay to directly compare traveling alone versus with companions, include a balanced discussion on both viewpoints before stating your preference, and refine the grammar and stylistic elements to enhance readability. Addressing these points can significantly improve the alignment with the prompt, the coherence of your argumentation, and the overall quality of the essay."}

While there is no denying that the high stakes of professional athletics have brought about guaranteed futures, prosperous living standards, and notability for many individuals, there are also negative effects to consider. Professional sports can have a detrimental impact on the physical, psychological, and emotional well-being of children. \\n One of the major drawbacks of participating in a specialized sport is the risk of injury to children's bodies. Young athletes often push themselves to the limit with intensive training tools in order to reach a higher level of performance, which can lead to serious problems. Due to their developing bones, children are particularly vulnerable to fractures, which can impede their progress towards advanced opportunities. Moreover, the pressure to excel in a particular field can cause undue stress and even negatively impact a child's mental well-being. \\n Participating in professional sports can also impact psychological and emotional well-being. The intense pressure from coaches, families, and peers can take a toll on a child's emotions. Additionally, striving to always be at the top of or losing their matches can hinder a young athlete's logical thinking. Without proper parental guidance, the character-building progress of young athletes may lead to anxiety, insecurity, and depression, and they may even behave in inappropriate ways. Over-practicing can also lead to detrimental habits such as cutting back on sleep, skipping meals, and neglecting their surroundings, which can contribute to feelings of depression. \\n In conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to attending professional sports events, there are also a multitude of drawbacks. Overpracticing can have severe physical consequences for children, and the high demands and peer pressure can negatively impact their mental health.

This approach will not only enhance the persuasiveness of your essay but also show a deeper analysis of the topic.\n\nIn terms of style and language, there's a need for clearer separation of ideas into distinct paragraphs. Each paragraph should ideally address a single main idea, supported by relevant examples or arguments. This will improve the overall readability and coherence of your essay.\n\nOn the grammatical front, watch out for minor errors that can distract from your message. Although these are not pervasive, careful proofreading can refine your essay's clarity and professionalism. Pay attention to sentence structure, ensuring variety and proper use of transitions to guide the reader smoothly from one idea to the next.\n\nFurthermore, it's crucial to maintain an objective tone throughout the essay. While it\u2019s clear you have strong viewpoints on the topic, ensure your language remains formal and your arguments are supported by evidence rather than just personal opinions. This will lend credibility and persuasiveness to your essay.\n\nFinally, your conclusion effectively summarizes the main points but could be enhanced by offering a clear call to action or suggesting potential solutions. This would not only round off your essay nicely but also leave the reader with something to ponder upon.\n\nBy refining these aspects of your essay, you can significantly improve its quality and effectiveness in conveying your argument. Remember, clarity of purpose, coherence in structure, and correctness in language are key pillars of an impactful essay."}

Sometimes it is better not to tell the truth.","essay_text":"Truth is always important, especially for a relationship between people. However, sometimes it is better not to tell the truth. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay. \\n First, being honest or telling the truth may hurt others feeling or make yourself feel nervous and unpleasant about what you did. For example, your friend has just cut her hair and she asks you if she looks good. In your opinion, her hair looks terrible and you are being honest about that. She might not angry with you but it will definitely hurt her feeling. Moreover, doctors often tell lies for patients benefit. The patient who has a serious health problem such as cancer should not know about their situation. Doctors want the patient to enjoy the happiness instead of worrying about death so they lied to give the patient hope. In some cases, it is better to lie about something and lies somehow make people live happier. \\n Second, it is acceptable for people to lie about personal information such as age, weight and relationship. Everyone has their own privacy and it should be respect by the others. These lies considered harmless so instead of telling the truth, people can lie so that it will not cause any awkward consequences. Furthermore, in some countries, it is rude when a man asks a woman about her age and it is okay if the woman lies about it. It will not hurt or harm to anyone. \\n Overall, it is true that people should not tell lies because of the negative effects that lie brings. Nevertheless, a lie is acceptable if it is harmless and it does not cause any serious problems. People can tell lies to give others hope and forget about the pain or people tell lies about personal stuff that they think it is necessary.","human_feedback_text":"Thao, grammar issues, which are minimal in consideration, aside, this is a very well thought out and defended essay. You accurately summed up the discussion points that strengthened your position presentation. However, I caution you against trying to present too many sides to the issue in one paragraph. It limits your ability to show off your English thinking skills. It is more important to show off the fact that you can accurately express yourself in English than to show off your knowledge about a certain topic. It is enough to show one reason and discuss that thoroughly because the examiner will get a clearer idea as to the level of English thinking and writing skills that you have. You don't get to successfully do that in this presentation. Good work though. You have the potential to pass the TOEFL with a high rating if you continue to practice and improve your skills in the coming days and months.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay addresses the topic, which is the importance of truth in relationships and circumstances where not telling the truth might be considered acceptable. The main argument is clear: there are instances where lying could be considered beneficial, provided it does not cause harm. This position is supported by two primary arguments - the potential harm caused by honesty and the acceptability of lying about personal information under certain circumstances. \n\nHowever, to improve the essay, attention to several areas is needed:\n\n1. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are minor spelling and grammar issues that need attention. For example, \"angry\" should be \"angry with\" in the context given, and \"feeling\" should be \"feelings\" to match plurality. It\u2019s important to carefully review and correct these mistakes to ensure clarity and professionalism in writing.\n\n2. **Clarity and Focus**: The essay could benefit from focusing on fewer arguments but exploring them more thoroughly. For instance, instead of briefly mentioning both the harm of honesty and the acceptability of privacy lies, pick one and dive deeper into it. This approach allows for more detailed examples and a clearer demonstration of your ability to express complex ideas in English.\n\n3. **Point of View**: While the author\u2019s point of view is present, it could be made more potent by firmly stating personal beliefs or experiences related to the topic. Doing so would make the essay more engaging and showcase the ability to express complex thought processes in English.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: The arguments presented are interesting, but they would benefit from more detailed examples and deeper exploration. For example, when discussing doctors lying to patients, more insight into how this action could specifically impact patient welfare would strengthen the argument. Similarly, discussing personal lies, more context or examples could make the argument more compelling.\n\n5. **Stylistic Issues**: It's important to ensure that each paragraph flows logically to the next. Avoid presenting too many ideas in one paragraph, as this can overwhelm the reader and detract from the clarity of your argument. \n\nBy focusing on these areas, the essay will not only become more structurally sound and coherent but will also better showcase English language proficiency. Remember, the goal is to demonstrate the ability to think critically and express complex ideas clearly in English, more than it is to cover a wide range of ideas superficially. Keep practicing and focusing on these aspects, and your writing will continue to improve."}

The most important disadvantage of travelling by air is cost. People always deliberate about cost when they choose a transportation to travel. The cost of the flight tickets is extremely high and also difficult to buy in some special occasions. For example, in New Year's Eve, the demand of travelling increases astonishingly so the flight tickets will be expensive and sold out immediately. Another additional disadvantage stems from bad weather as well as technical problems or even terrorisms; therefore, these incidents may lead the flight to be at stake. As the result of that, scheduled flights will be postponed or cancelled hourly which is inconvenient for passengers. A delay of a few minutes is not serious but a long delay can force passengers to miss an important engagement. Lastly, it is a thorny problem for people who have airsickness because they are not able to travel by air eventhough they desire to have a flight. In conclusion, I think you should consider cautiously before making a decision to travel.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, you spelled \"even though\" as one word when it should have been spelled as two words, separated by a space to indicate 2 words of connected meaning. You should have also used a comma because of the conjunction in the presentation of; \"... minutes is not serious , but a long delay can force passengers...\" Remember use a comma to connect 2 different topics of relevant discussion in a single sentence. There are also instances when you should have considered using verbs instead of nouns such as in the case of the following: \\n ... before making a decision to travel.... \\n - ... before DECIDING to travel... \\n ... benefits but there are a number of disadvantages... \\n - ... but there are SEVERAL disadvantages... \\n Since you did not specify if this was supposed to be for an IELTS test or just an English writing exercise, I decided to review your work using US English.

However, there are several areas that could benefit from improvement to make your essay stronger.\n\nFirstly, attention to spelling and grammar will enhance the clarity and professionalism of your essay. The phrase \"even though\" should be two separate words, not combined into one. This mistake can confuse readers and detract from the quality of your writing. Additionally, be mindful of when to use commas, especially when connecting two ideas in a sentence. For example, in \"A delay of a few minutes is not serious , but a long delay can force passengers...\" a comma before \"but\" is necessary because it connects two distinct but related ideas.\n\nYour choice of words could be more precise. For instance, instead of saying \"before making a decision to travel,\" a simpler and more direct way to convey this idea would be \"before deciding to travel.\" Similarly, rather than saying \"there are a number of disadvantages,\" it could be more impactful to state \"there are several disadvantages.\" These adjustments can make your sentences clearer and more impactful.\n\nIn terms of content, your essay effectively outlines several disadvantages of air travel, making your viewpoint clear. However, incorporating more detailed examples or personal experiences could strengthen your arguments. When discussing the high cost of flight tickets, for example, providing specific, relatable examples can make your argument more convincing and engaging for the reader.\n\nYour essay could also benefit from a more structured conclusion. The current conclusion suggests caution when choosing to travel by air but does not succinctly summarize the key points discussed in the essay. A stronger conclusion might recap the main disadvantages of air travel you've outlined, solidifying your position for the reader.\n\nIn summary, your essay has a clear point of view and successfully addresses the topic. To improve, focus on refining spelling and grammar, choosing words for clarity and impact, enhancing your arguments with specific examples, and strengthening your conclusion.

Almost companies nowadays prefer to recruit young personnel who have both skills and experiences, so if people taking so much time to find a job can miss the opportunities. Plus, changing jobs frequently can cost much money to return to study from the beginning, while they have to earn money for the study. People who can not determine what to do won't have a fulfilling working life nor professional satisfaction and success. \\n In conclusion, I believe people should decide on a career as soon as possible if they want to have a fulfilling life in the future, because changing jobs frequently can only bring difficulties and heartbreak in life.","human_feedback_text":"The first paragraph is not well developed.

Ensuring that every paragraph solidly supports your main argument will strengthen your essay's focus. Consider revising your introduction to more clearly state your opinion and directly answer the essay question.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues:** There are instances of grammatical errors (e.g., \"require people to find an answer for themself\" should be \"requires people to find an answer for themselves\") and stylistic issues that hinder readability.

Each paragraph should then begin with a clear topic sentence that introduces the argument or evidence you will present.\n\n4. **Arguments Supporting the Author's Position:** You provide arguments on both the benefits of early career decisions and the drawbacks of indecision. However, the essay would benefit from a more focused approach that consistently supports your viewpoint. For instance, instead of merely stating the disadvantages of not choosing early, illustrate with more detailed examples or evidence how early decision-makers have achieved success. This will strengthen your argument and make it more persuasive.\n\n5. **Unified Argumentation:** As highlighted, providing reasoning for both perspectives can dilute your argument. Concentrate on defending your viewpoint with strong, well-evidenced arguments. You might consider removing or revising sections that discuss the opposite side of your argument, except as a means to refute them and strengthen your own position.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion successfully reiterates your main points but could be enhanced by also emphasizing the broader implications of your argument for personal fulfillment and professional success. A strong closing thought can leave a lasting impression on your reader.\n\nBy refining your essay's structure, clarifying your argument, and addressing grammatical and stylistic issues, you can create a more compelling and understandable piece. Focus on providing clear, evidenced arguments for your viewpoint and ensure every part of your essay contributes towards supporting your main thesis."}

Many people reckon that family is sufficient for their lives and it is unnecessary to have friends. From my perspective, however, good friends are also significant in our lives and there are a lot of circumstances when family is unable to make up for the drawbacks of having no friends. \\n Although the significance of family is undisputable, the precious values of friendship should not be ignored. Family plays a crucial role in everyone's life since they are reliable ones whom we can turn to for advice when encountering difficulties and obstacles. However, there are plenty of intimate secrets that are impossible to share with parents such as love affairs or financial status, mainly due to a huge generation gap and a fear of making them worried. In these circumstances, sharing with good friends would be preferable thanks to mutual understandings and common notions. \\n Besides, family members are likely to become trustworthy and ideal friends. In fact, children who have siblings might consider their sisters or brothers as wonderful companions. In addition, teenagers who have suffered bullying in schools might isolate themselves from their peers while family is always tolerant of their mistakes and imperfections, making them more confident and pleasant. However, parents are incapable of accompanying their kids on many occasions but only friends could do. For example, youngsters often show a great preference for traveling with a couple of their friends rather than with family. It is understandable since young people are likely to be appealed by extreme sports, adventurous trips, and once-in-a-lifetime challenges, whereas parents who belong to the previous generation do not seem to be enthusiastic about these unconventional experiences. \\n In conclusion, both family and friendship are key drivers to a happy and fulfilled life. It is agreeable that family is an indispensable part of our lives, however, it can not completely replace the existence of good friends.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>There is a universal controversy<\/quotation> \\n Where is this indicated in the original prompt?

By playing such sports, people can take advantage from the cooperation of their teammates. In team sports, members have to work together to achieve a common goal, which can bring bigger results. On the other hand, team sports instil a level of competition. Working together as a team creates a healthy competitive edge that can only bode well for the team and each individual within it. For instance, each football player tends to try to practice harder to be as good as their teammates. \\n Nevertheless, individual sports like tennis can be particularly beneficial for everyone because they help develop self-esteem and concentration while encouraging physical activity. In the busy world of today, individual sports bring people more flexibility as they can play those types of sports whenever they have free time. In parallel with the flexibility of time, individual sport players also have chance to set up level of training at their own space. Moreover, individual sports help foster the independence of the sport players even in the matters that are out of sport. For example, in tennis, a player is responsible for every move he makes.

Because of that, living longer will help them finish their wishes. \\n On the other hand, I think this improvement in the health care will lead to some negative impacts. Firstly, retired people could be feel lonely between their family members because those members also struggle to make earnings as the old before. They also could be a burden if they have health problems and need to be looked after to recover. Secondly, they could become a social problem due to the higher life expectancy.

Although they are not sure about their mother tongue, they have to learn another new language, causing the fact that they may not control both languages and easily be misunderstood by other people. As a result, it may affect the children's development in terms of language. \\n However, the disadvantages of studying another language might be eclipsed by its benefits.

Therefore, they are more likely to become bilingual faster than those who begin learning another language in their later age. A recent survey by Cambridge University found that chidren studying another language in their early age tend to be multilingual than others. Another merit is that children could use time wisely when studying an overseas language. In primary schools, there may be very little things or tasks for children to do; hence, it is better to give children a task or a lesson about learning a new language, which may prevent them from doing other detrimental activities, such as watching screens or playing video games. \\n In conclusion, there are some disadvantages of learning another language at primary schools.

The essay's structure typically benefits from presenting arguments that solely support your opinion when the task is to persuade or argue for one side. Introducing opposing viewpoints without clearly favoring one can detract from the effectiveness of your argumentation.\n\nRegarding the sentence \"On the one hand,\" remember that your essay should aim to persuade the reader of your viewpoint consistently. Introducing contrasting points might confuse readers about your stance. Focus on providing strong, supportive evidence and reasoning for your argument to guide the reader clearly through your perspective.\n\nThe use of the phrase \"might be eclipsed\" introduces uncertainty into your argument. In an opinion essay, certainty and clarity regarding your position are paramount. Phrases that suggest doubt can weaken the persuasive force of your essay. It's beneficial to assert your claims confidently and back them up with clear, compelling reasons.\n\nSpelling and grammar are also areas for attention. For instance, \"chidren\" should be corrected to \"children.\" Ensuring correct spelling is crucial for maintaining the professionalism of your essay. \n\nWhen discussing the benefits of learning a foreign language at a young age, you've provided strong arguments, such as the ease with which young children can acquire new languages and the productive use of their time. However, these could be further strengthened by specifying how mastering a new language directly benefits children's cognitive development and future opportunities.\n\nYour conclusion does well to restate your main points but remember to avoid introducing new arguments here. This part of the essay is for summarizing your previously made points and reinforcing your stance.\n\nIn summary, focus on presenting a clear, direct opinion from the start, support your views with specific and confident arguments, and pay close attention to spelling and grammar. Following these suggestions will help make your essay more compelling and persuasive."}

Some people argue that rural zones have more benefits for them because of their environmental factors, while others assert that cities include more facilities. Personally, I am in favour of the latter view. \\n On the one hand, many individuals believe that the countryside has many advantages for children and provides a healthy environment for them. Precisely, rural places contain less air and noise pollution, additionally, homes are quite bigger and include big outdoor spaces as well. For instance, children who are spending their childhood in these locations will have both physical and mental health because they have enough space to playing and doing exercises and also breathe the air with better quality. Furthermore, it could be said that these locations are beneficial considering their environmental factors. \\n On the other hand, Some persons think that cities provide more facilities like educational, sport, and health centres. This group of people argue that youngsters should have an opportunity to have access to the best academic institutions and likewise, sports centres to spending their free time there. For example, if kids spend their childhood in urban areas, they will have a chance to experience the best schools and for their free hours use the most modern gym facilities. Consequently, it is worth pointing out that cities provide a situation for them to grow up in a modern and standard place.","human_feedback_text":"You have to understand that you are writing a single opinion essay. Therefore, there is no need for you to defend both sides of the discussion. Why should not state reasons for both sides? Well, it is mainly because you are asked in the writing instruction for a single opinion. Either you agree or disagree. If you agree that children are better raised in rural areas, then you need to present 2 reasons why that is your opinion. When you defend both points of view, you fail to represent the task scoring requirement that indicates the need to represent a clear and single opinion. In this case, you failed to clearly present the reasons supporting your opinion because you decided to discuss both positive points of each opinion. \\n When you are asked to present a single opinion for a question, make sure that what you discuss will be the reasons why the opposing discussion is incorrect. For example, you could say: \\n <em>While living in the city gives access to modern medicine, specially in relation to breathing related illnesses, living in the rural areas allows people to breathe in clean, fresh air. By breathing in good air, people will not need medical treatment related to lung and breathing problems as they would in the city.<\/em> \\n Take an opposite discussion that sounds positive, then turn it on its head and prove it is a negative. The above example does that by saying \"the need for city based modern medicine in relation to lung problems can be avoided by living in the country since the air there is cleaner.\" By discussing in this manner, you strengthen and clearly explain the basis of your opinion. In the process, you allow the reader to better understand your way of thinking in terms of the discussion topic. \\n In this version, only the second reason will be given a score since it is the only one actually related to your opinion. So the essay is lacking one supporting statement, which means the essay cannot be considered properly and fully developed. It will be reflected in the cohesiveness of the discussion. It incorrectly discusses the topic and therefore, fails to prove your opinion as being the correct one.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay attempts to explore whether rural or urban areas are more suitable for children to grow up in. While the effort to address the topic is evident, the approach taken does not fully align with the requirements of presenting a clear, single opinion as suggested by the task. The essay presents arguments for both sides of the discussion, which, although informative, detracts from forming a cohesive stance on the issue. To improve, focus should be placed on supporting a singular perspective with detailed reasoning.\n\n1. Firstly, the essay should clearly state the chosen viewpoint right from the beginning and then consistently defend this perspective throughout. Since the preference for urban areas is mentioned, subsequent arguments should solely bolster this opinion. This approach will not only meet the task's expectations but also enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the argumentation.\n\n2. Concerning language aspects, there are minor spelling and grammatical issues that require attention. For instance, \"concider\" should be corrected to \"consider,\" and attention should be paid to the usage of singular and plural forms (\"Some persons think\" could be better expressed as \"Some people think\") to ensure grammatical consistency. Additionally, the essay could benefit from varied sentence structures and transitions to improve flow and readability.\n\n3. The point of view is identifiable; however, it's diluted by the presentation of counterarguments without a clear rebuttal. Strengthening the essay involves more than stating preferences; it necessitates the provision of compelling, specific reasons and examples that underscore why urban areas are superior for children's upbringing, thereby reinforcing the author's stance.\n\n4. To develop clear and descriptive arguments, pick key benefits of urban living that directly impact children's growth positively and delve deeper into these points. For example, if accessing high-quality education and modern healthcare facilities are primary advantages, elaborate on how these factors contribute to a child's overall development and future success. Comparisons to rural living should be made to highlight the shortcomings of the latter in these areas, without dedicating equal weight to the benefits of rural environments.\n\nBy refining the focus on a singular opinion, addressing language precision, and deepening the analysis supporting the chosen viewpoint, the essay can significantly improve both in coherence and persuasiveness. Remember, the goal is not only to state a preference but to convincingly argue why one option is preferable, making your case compelling to the reader."}

The provided opinion, while valuable, needs to be framed within the context of the question's demand for an analysis of \"extent.\" A more direct response to the question, perhaps by comparing the merits of extreme changes versus a normal life and then positioning your argument, would make the essay more aligned with the prompt and improve its relevance.\n\n2. **Word Count**: The essay is slightly under the ideal word count range.

To illustrate, in term of choosing place to hang out with friends or the kind of food that they consume, this is actually not a good method to raise children. Due to the fact that the spots on which young people want to hold an entertainment might be full of danger, for instance many innocent children tend to play on the street and put themselves on the edge of risky accidents. In addition, parents ought to put some set of restrictions on their children when choosing food to eat in order to make sure that children consume enough nutrients and grow well. \\n The next adverse effect when young young people have the whole autonomy is lower grades and unbearable behaviours. Because of the indifference and the laziness to study, young people have no aspiration for education as they did in the last century. Consequently, they will end up with poor grades. Parents must spend more time caring for their children's study for the sake of them in future. Apart from disciplines on study, aldults also need to set some regulations on their children's demeanours. In recent years, young people tend to behave unacceptably, they have no respect for others.

After reviewing your work, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance your argument and the clarity of your writing.\n\n1. **Addressing the Topic**: It seems you have misunderstood the original prompt's requirement. The essay needed to directly respond to the opinion given in the prompt. Instead, you chose a side without framing it as an agreement or disagreement with the given statement. It's important to directly answer the question asked. For example, had the prompt been \"To what extent do you agree with giving young people full autonomy?\" a more suitable response might have been, \"I completely disagree with giving young people full autonomy for two main reasons...\" This approach directly addresses the task and sets a clear foundation for your argument.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are a few spelling and grammar errors that disrupt the flow of reading.

What problems do these people usually face? \\n Suggest some ways that the government can help people to better prepare for their old age \\n It has become apparent in recent years that ageing population is becoming a serious issue. In this essay, the problems these elderly people are facing will be considered and some practical solutions will be outlined. \\n To begin with, it is conceivable that elderly people do not have as steady a budget as middle-aged ones. If the elderly do not have children or their children cannot afford their expenses, the elderly at that time have no choice but to count on the pension benefits provided by the government as soon as they retire. In some developed countries, the old people still manage to live on their retirement benefits, whereas in developing countries, this could be a serious problem. For the reason that developing countries have to take care of different aspects within their limited budget, these countries probably cannot guarantee that every senior citizen receives sufficient pensions. As a consequence, the elderly's living standards are in decline and they may not be able to fend for themselves. One possible approach to alleviating this problem is that the government should encourage the young and middle-aged people to take a small amount from their every-month salaries and save it in the bank. Upon doing this, in the future, as they get older, they are bound to have enough money to live on their own. \\n Moreover, as people age, they are more susceptible to age-related health issues. It is noticeable that people over the age of 65 are more prone to diseases such as cancer and diabetes mellitus. If the elderly do not take immediate action, these diseases will get worse and cause death. Since the elderly do not have enough money, they would rather stay at home than go to the hospital and medical clinic for treatment because healthcare could cost a fortune. One measure that could be taken to address this problem is to spur people to exercise from a young age and have a healthy diet. In a 2018 study, an international group of researchers led by scientists found that having a healthy diet and exercising at a moderate level could extend life expectancy by 14 years for women and by 12 years for men. \\n To summarize, as people age, if they do not take good precautions, they will encounter loads of problems. To prevent these problems from happening, we should start taking actions by gradually saving money from our earnings, having a healthy balanced diet and taking exercises.","human_feedback_text":"The prompt restatement is incomplete. The age of the elderly citizen must be mentioned in a new way as this is an integral part of the original topic information. It is not just a general elderly scenario.

A fully developed discussion paragraph will present: \\n - The problem \\n - Why it is a problem \\n - Sugggested government solution \\n - Why the solution will work \\n The discussions you present are too busy and not fully relevant to the government responsibility aspect. The presentation of information does not consistently show a government solution based on their responsibility. Rather, it encourages personal solutions, removing the responsibility of the government, which is the basis of the solution discussion.

The essay clearly attempts to respond to the provided topic by identifying problems faced by the elderly population and suggesting ways the government can assist. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance the clarity, relevance, and effectiveness of the discussion.\n\nFirstly, it's important to more accurately restate the topic, ensuring to specify that the discussion concerns the elderly, traditionally defined as those over the age of 65. This detail helps focus the essay on the specific group discussed in the original prompt. When you introduce the topic, try to rephrase this information in a new way to clearly set the stage for your arguments.\n\nIn terms of structure, while your essay presents problems and potential solutions, these are somewhat intertwined and could benefit from clearer organization. Each paragraph should focus on a single topic, starting with a statement of the problem related to the ageing population, followed by why it's a problem, a potential government solution, and why that solution is effective. This structure will make your arguments more comprehensible and directly aligned with the essay prompt. For example, when discussing financial instability among the elderly, mention that this is a problem because it affects their standard of living, then suggest a governmental solution such as increasing pension funds or subsidizing healthcare specifically for the elderly, and explain how this could alleviate the issue.\n\nThere's a tendency in your essay to veer towards personal responsibility solutions, such as individuals saving money or leading a healthier lifestyle. While these are valuable strategies, the task requires a focus on government interventions. Therefore, revisiting your solutions to emphasize actions that the government can take, rather than individual actions, would make your essay more aligned with the prompt's requirements. For instance, instead of mainly advocating for personal savings, propose how the government could incentivize or facilitate this process through policies or programs.\n\nRegarding language use, there are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues that could be refined. Pay attention to sentence structure for clarity and conciseness. Using simpler language will not only make your essay easier to understand but also ensure that your arguments are communicated effectively. \n\nFinally, your point of view is discernible but could be stated more explicitly for added impact. Make sure each section of your essay clearly contributes to building your argument, leading to a cohesive conclusion that reinforces your perspective.\n\nOverall, your essay has a strong base discussing a pertinent issue. Focusing on clearer organization, emphasizing government solutions, and fine-tuning your language use will significantly improve your essay.

I am of the opinion that advertising is useless and increases cost for the company without bringing in any benefit. \\n First, some people think that advertising can push viewers into action because constant bombardment of information can somehow manipulate human's mind. They believe that if a message is repeated again and again, it becomes the truth in someone's mind. For example, if BMW's commercial shows that drivers of BMW are successful, intelligent and good looking, then that image is imprinted into the minds of the viewers. Then, the viewers will become customers of BMW because their conjecture is that buying the car will make them successful, intelligent and good looking just like the drivers in BMW's commercial. \\n On the contrary, some people believe that the more a commercial is shown, the less effective it is. People are so tired of seeing the same thing over and over again that they do not care anymore and do not retain any information from it. To them, advertisements of cars, toys, or food look all the same - they do not even know what they are watching.

For instance, introducing statistics or findings from studies on advertising effectiveness could lend more credibility to your arguments.\n\nIn summary, focus on simplifying your language for clarity, crafting a balanced argument with robust evidence, and adhering to the suggested word count to manage your time effectively during the test.

Personally, I disagree with these ideas and will outline my reasons in the essay below. \\n Nowadays, obtaining a university degree no longer has a vital role to get a good job in the future of young people even in this knowledge-based society. Firstly, in recent years, the demand for labor who gain specific skills or practical skills is increasing rapidly, which opens the door to better career prospects as well as job security for graduates of vocational school. These make vocational education more popular among young people, become a substitute for academic courses. Secondly, if the government intervenes deeply in the structure of the labor market, that would cause imbalances in the workforce because it could not only lead to an abundance of university graduates who are less likely to choose blue-collar jobs such as machine operators or technicians but also cause the shortage of skilled workers. \\n On the other hand, I think that it is impossible to support a large number of young people to be admitted to college. On top of that, paying for all exorbitant education costs will put a financial burden on the national budget. The government is likely to face a high risk of a budget deficit. Viet Nam, in fact, is a developing country with limited resources the government needs to allocate its national budget properly for other key areas which also promote sustainable development, such as the economy and healthcare. Additionally, the limitation of the human resources and material facilities, which has not kept pace with the soaring number of students on campus, leads to the degradation of tertiary education. \\n I conclusion, I strongly oppose the idea of dispensing university education to a high proportion of young people owing to the arguments presented above","human_feedback_text":"The writer offers a basic disagreement rather than the required emotional extent response As asked by the discussion prompt. The writer must provide a degree of support to help convince the reader of his conviction in his point of meer. The response format is incomplete and also, could be considered incorrect by some examiners. The scores are affected when expected response formats are not used by the writer when creating the thesis sentence. Always provide proper response to avoid partial or non - application of section scores. \\n The response paragraphs are comparative where single opinion presentations are needed. The whole point is to convince the reader that the disagreement is the correct opinion. However, using a comparison that gives support to both ideas destroys the previously stated opinion. Where there was once a clear opinion, only a questionable opinion is seen by the lader. This will cause the essay to not fulfill opinion clarity requirements and instead be scored based on a confusing and stressful presentation..","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay provides a structured argument against the provision of tertiary education to a vast majority, focusing on financial constraints and the market demand for vocational skills over academic degrees. However, there are areas where this essay could be improved to more effectively convey your perspective and to ensure it aligns better with the expectations of an English proficiency test essay.\n\n1. **Response to Topic:** You present a clear disagreement with the notion of universally accessible university education, which is good. However, your argument would benefit from a more direct and emotionally impactful response to emphasize your conviction. You should explicitly state your stance in the introduction and then reinforce this stance throughout the essay without comparing it too closely with opposing viewpoints. This approach helps to avoid diluting the strength of your own argument.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** In general, your essay is well-written, but there are some grammatical errors and sentences that could be clearer. Pay attention to sentence structure to ensure your ideas are expressed clearly and concisely. Additionally, some of your arguments could be made stronger with more precise language and specific examples. Avoid complex sentences where simpler ones will do, as clarity is essential for your readers.\n\n3. **Point of View:** Your viewpoint against widespread tertiary education is recognizable, but it needs to be emphasized more strongly throughout the essay. The introduction and conclusion should firmly state your position to ensure that the reader is left with no doubt about your stance. Avoid presenting comparative arguments that might make your own viewpoint seem less convincing.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** While your essay includes arguments supporting your position, they would be stronger with more detailed evidence and a focus on emotionally compelling reasons. Instead of offering a balanced view that inadvertently supports both sides of the argument, concentrate on developing well-supported points that solely back your viewpoint. This strategy will help to clearly demonstrate why your disagreement is justified and persuade the reader of its validity.\n\nIn summary, make your stance more impactful and direct, refine your writing for clarity and grammatical precision, and strengthen your arguments with specific, supportive details. Focusing on these improvements will enhance the persuasiveness and clarity of your essay, forging a stronger connection with your readers."}

This essay disagrees with this thesis. Firstly, not all sources of information online are reliable. Secondly, not everybody is used to seeking news online, therefore newspapers are for them still the major reference. \\n First off, during the last decade, the advent of the Internet has been followed by an ever-increasing flow of fake news. Instances of websites that constantly publish wrong information abound online, thus discouraging people from being attracted by free-online vehicles of information. For this reason, most people still tend to buy physical newspapers instead of reading free-online websites. This condition has been proved by a recent investigation. It has shown that newspapers' and magazines' sales have only decreased by 2 per cent throughout a 10-year period. This redoubtably suggests that printed information is still popular. \\n On the other hand, although more people than before have access to online information, there's still a remarkable part of the population that is recalcitrant about embracing the innovation. Indeed, mostly seniors or mid-aged people prefer buying paper journals rather than reading online information either because they don't have an Internet connection or because, even though they are connected, those aren't able to search online for what they need. As a matter of fact, almost three-quarters of printed-news consumers are older than the average online users. \\n To conclude, despite a downtrend in the newspapers' distribution, evidence suggests that this way of diffusing information is not set to retire yet both because people still trust them and also because not everyone has direct access to online resources.","human_feedback_text":"While your prompt restatement is good, you need to use a first person pronoun to indicate the degree of your disagreement with the given thesis. The question clearly asks, \"To what extent do YOU...\" So that means, you should offer up an emotional response to the question. (e.g. I fully disagree with this thesis). The last line that includes the reference to \"therefore newspapers\", should be a new sentence. A comma cannot be used in that case because you are referring to a different discussion topic in the sentence already. As for the concluding summary, you should review your work. This is a run-on sentence presentation. The requirement is to have at least 3 sentences in the presentation. You should have divided the presentation to meet the requirement.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay addresses the topic well, arguing against the idea that printed newspapers and books will be replaced by free online content. Here are some points to help improve your essay further:\n\n1. **Personal Opinion and Clarity**: The prompt asks for your personal viewpoint with the phrase \"To what extent do you agree or disagree?\". It's important to express your own views more clearly by using first-person pronouns. For example, instead of \"This essay disagrees with this thesis,\" you could say, \"I fully disagree with this statement...\" This will make your viewpoint clearer and add a personal touch to your argument.\n\n2. **Sentence Structure and Grammar**: You've managed to convey your ideas, but there are a few areas where sentence structure and grammar need improvement:\n    - When introducing a new idea, make sure to start a new sentence. For instance, the transition in your argument about people preferring newspapers should be clearer with sentences properly separated.\n    - Be mindful of run-on sentences, especially in your conclusion. Each sentence should convey one complete thought. Your concluding summary currently runs on and could be divided into at least three separate sentences for clarity and better flow.\n\n3. **Stylistic Issues**: Although your essay is structured logically, paying attention to stylistic nuances can enhance readability and engagement. For instance:\n    - Use transitions smoothly to connect ideas between paragraphs.\n    - Vary sentence structure to maintain the reader's interest.\n\n4. **Arguments and Supporting Evidence**: You've provided solid arguments and referenced an investigation to support your viewpoint, which strengthens your essay. However, consider adding more details or examples to further bolster your claims. For example, discussing the value people find in the tactile experience of reading printed material could enhance your argument.\n\n5. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are minor spelling and grammar mistakes. Always proofread to catch these errors. For example, pay attention to the correct spelling of \"extent\" and the use of \"free-accessible\" might be better stated as \"freely accessible\" or \"accessible for free.\"\n\n6. **Clarity on the Point of View**: It\u2019s great that your essay presents a clear stance against the given statement. However, adding more personal insights or emotional responses can make your argument even more compelling.\n\nBy incorporating these improvements, your essay will not only be more aligned with the expectations of the prompt but also more engaging and persuasive to the reader. Keep up the good work, and remember, practice and careful review are key to improvement."}

Despite some obvious cons of this trend, I believe that these are outweighed by the pros. \\n On the one hand, there are a number of major drawbacks when consuming a wide range of local foods. The first drawback is that customers will be more fastidious because of the popularity of local flavor dishes. As a result, the food and beverage industry will face challenges in satisfying their local customers like changing the recipe, and ingredients,... it also means that this action will take time, and money also. \\n On the other hand, I believe that the benefits are more significant than such drawbacks. there are several major benefits when consuming inter foods. The first advantage is that consumers can stimulate their nation's economy and save a budget that spending on food. This is because the price of local foods is always affordable due to the common ingredients of their country, and by purchasing a product of a restaurant, the customers are likely to create a working environment and raise income for the workers. The second reason is that consuming local foods is likely a solution to protect the environment.

Make sure your opening sentence clearly presents your topic and stance to avoid misunderstanding.

For instance, when you mention the economic stimulation and environmental protection provided by consuming local foods, delve deeper into how exactly these benefits outweigh the drawbacks mentioned.

People try to improve their own health condition, either by working out more or reducing their stress. However, neither of them is as important as a healthy diet. In my opinion, I would choose to pay more attention on the food I consume in order to boost my health. \\n First of all, there is a wide variety of food I can choose to keep a healthy diet. For example, salads are easy to make and are nutritious as well. Or I can simply cook my own food instead of having meals in other restaurants. This definitely saves a lot of money and guarantees dishes without that many additives. Some people may assume that eating clean means taking in food with plain taste or hardly edible cuisines. In fact, healthy food can be quite delicious and eating always keeps me happy. Compared to exercising or finding ways to relax, I believe choosing the food I eat undoubtedly provides me with more options. \\n Secondly, it is apparently easier to regulate what I eat than to be determined to do exercise or to relax. Sometimes, I just don't have time to go to the gym or go for a run. After a long day of working or studying, fatigue strikes me and I don't have more energy and time to work out. Nevertheless, I need to eat. I simply have to be more careful on what I eat, and in this way my health status can be improved. In addition, it is obvious I cannot easily limit the stress in my life. I cannot foresee the challenges and frustration that I am going to encounter. Therefore, it is more difficult to cut down on the amount of stress than to examine the food I eat. \\n Health is extremely indispensable and everyone should be able to take care of his\/her own body. I am strongly convinced that keeping a healthy diet is a better way to improve both the physical and the mental health.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, since you were being asked a direct question in the prompt, you could have done a better job at representing the opening statement in order to make it more interesting to the examiner.

Ensuring such details can improve the overall flow and clarity of your essay.\n\n3. **Author's Point of View:** Your viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. You convincingly argue that regulating the kind of food you eat is the most critical factor for improving health. To further solidify your perspective, consider integrating more personal anecdotes or broader statistical evidence to bolster your claims. This can provide a more robust foundation for your argument.\n\n4. **Arguments to Support the Position:** You provide clear and descriptive arguments to support your position, such as the variety and accessibility of healthy food options, and the practical challenges of regulating exercise and stress.

It is hard to tell whether the phenomenon delivers a more beneficial impact on the society than opposite trend or not. As a result, I will address my own perspective as follows. \\n Personally, the only drawback for the situation is the wrong replacement for job vacancies. For most entrepreneurs or supervisors in the company, they assume that older people are overpaid and can be easily replaced by younger workers who can do the job as well. But the scientific evidence on this issue shows differently: When it comes to learning new things, there is just no age limit. In addition, older workforce can provide their career experiences to younger employees. If those supervisors don't pay enough attention on the management of HR, the company may have serious damages and contribute to outflow of talent due to the misunderstanding of the age trend. \\n However, the phenomenon can be accompanied by some advantages. Firstly, the debt stemmed from the elderly will not take toll on their descendants' remaining life. The debt will be not only on the aspect of money but also the physical tolerance. For instance, if the elderly have a long-lived life, their sons, daughters or even grandsons will have to devote themselves to taking good care of them. What's worse, they need to pay medical expense for hospitalisation. In contrast, if young adults outweigh the elderly, the terrible situation can be soothed since more adults can share responsibility for carrying the burden. \\n In conclusion, although merits and demerits coexist in this age trend, I personally believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.","human_feedback_text":"You weakened your discussion by providing a comparative essay instead of strongly discussing the reasons supporting your opinion.

That is how how give a strong discussion foundation to your reasoning discussion. \\n One of the main scoring points is the clarity of your opinion from the very start. That means, you have to indicate your direct response to the question within the prompt paraphrase.

However, to make your essay stronger and more focused, consider the following points for improvement:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: It appears that your essay attempts to address the topic by weighing the pros and cons of a youthful population compared to an elderly one. However, the prompt requires a clear stance from the beginning. To improve, state your position explicitly in the introduction. This means directly saying whether you believe the benefits outweigh the negatives or vice versa, rather than suggesting you will explore both sides. This will help the reader understand your main point of view right from the start.\n\n2. **Structural and Stylistic Issues**: The essay would benefit from a clearer structure that aligns with a single opinion essay format. Instead of dividing the body into two parts that discuss advantages and disadvantages, dedicate the first body paragraph to fully explaining your main reason for your viewpoint. Use the second paragraph to expand on this with a detailed example or further explanation. This approach will strengthen your argument and make the essay more persuasive.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: While you do eventually state a personal belief that the benefits of a younger majority population outweigh the drawbacks, this viewpoint needs to be clear and present from the introduction. Strengthen this by revising your thesis statement in the introduction to explicitly reflect your stance, ensuring that readers are not left guessing about your position on the matter.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: Your essay presents arguments for both sides of the issue but could be improved by focusing on supporting your own viewpoint more robustly. When you introduce an argument, such as the value older workers bring to a workplace or the potential relief of familial burdens, delve deeper into these points with concrete examples or data. This could involve citing studies or statistics that support the benefits of having a more youthful or elderly population, depending on your stance.\n\nIn terms of language and mechanics, there are a few areas where simplification and correction could enhance readability and accuracy. For example:\n\n- Consider revising phrases like \"wrong replacement for job vacancies\" to something clearer, such as \"incorrectly replacing older workers with younger ones.\"\n- Be mindful of general spelling, grammar, and punctuation to ensure your ideas are communicated as clearly as possible.\n\nBy addressing these points, your essay can become a more powerful and compelling piece of writing. Remember, clarity of your position, structured argumentation, and detailed support are key to successfully persuading your reader of your viewpoint."}

However, the essay needs to more directly address the specific questions posed by the prompt: to what extent the author agrees with using punishment as a teaching method and what kinds of punishment, if any, are deemed appropriate by the author for parents and teachers to use.\n\n2. **Structure and Clarity**:\n- The essay lacks a clear structure that aligns with the requirements of the prompt.

I disagree with this view, because I consider that both above factors have their distinctive merits and should each play an integral in the life of children. \\n On the one hand, I would argue that the outer environments have certain effects on children. From an knowledge perspective, the children are learnt from teachers in the school, who have responsibilities to communicate the basic science lessons, which foster the development of children's brain. Futhermore, the extracurrilar activities enable teenagers to increase their soft skills as well as relationships. For example, the holiday camp which is annually held in summers creates more opportunities for children to make new friends. In addition, competition activities make it easer than ever for them to improve their presentation capability via debate contests, the finesse via cooking matches, the health via sport matches. \\n On the other hand, I believe that the parently influences are equally essential to offspring's improvement. Firstly, parents' upbringing have large role in sharping their children's character and behavior. For instance, a child who is being loved and taught about selflessness would tend to become an altruist. Secondly, the home traditions would contribute to children's aptitudes which are positive impact on their intelligence. A good example for this is the family where the father is a chess veteran. This ideal background could creates favorable conditions for his descendant to study and develop chess skill from an early age. \\n In conclusion, it seem to me that the family and social are equally important elements in development of children, and I disagree that the home's impact is outweighed by the effect from surrouding enironment.","human_feedback_text":"This is still a single opinion discussion even if the writer considers both arguments to be correct.

For example, discuss how qualities learned in external environments, like schools, can be nurtured or complemented by family interactions and vice versa.\n\nRegarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are several points to note:\n- Be mindful of spelling errors (e.g., \"youngster's growth\" should be \"youngsters' growth,\" \"futhermore\" should be \"furthermore,\" \"easer\" should be \"easier\").\n- Pay attention to word choice and accuracy (e.g., \"parently influences\" might better be stated as \"parental influences,\" \"sharping\" should be \"shaping\").\n- The use of terms like \"the outer environments\" and \"the parently influences\" is a bit awkward.

Thanks in advance. \\n Here is my essay: \\n It is true that these days more part-time jobs are stimulated for adolescents to pick up while they are still in school in many places. Despite some obvious advantages of this issue, I would argue that these are outweighed by the disadvantages. \\n On the one hand, there are two major benefits when teenagers take a part-time work. Firstly, starting to work at a young age prepares children more adequately for adult life. It teaches them how to react and behave in situations they would not encounter at home or at school. For example, many teenagers with a part-time job can easily adapt to life compare to the others. Secondly, children often have to work part-time to help their parents make end meet which also makes them appreciate the value of hard work and money. \\n On the other hand, I believe that the drawbacks are more than such advantages. One reason for this view is that children could not possibly do a job with school duties and extracurricular activities. If teenagers have to work part-time, their study could not be totally concentrated which leads to a poor academic result later. Besides, having to work and go to school at the same time would greatly reduce the amount of time children can spend with their parents or their friends. Another reason is that adolescents are vulnerable and can be easily exploited by employers. In some developing countries, children do manual labour under terrible conditions that can be a severe problem to their health. \\n In conclusion, it seems to me that the disadvantages of part-time job for teenagers are more significant the the advantages.","human_feedback_text":"You clearly understood the topic for discussion.

This approach allows you to explore each argument in detail without rushing or skimping on supporting information. It also improves readability, making your essay easier to follow.\n\n3. **Word Count**: Increasing your essay's length to between 275 and 290 words can significantly enhance its depth and the richness of your argument. Aim for 3-5 sentences for the introduction and conclusion each.

Pay particular attention to consistency in verb tenses and subject-verb agreement. Additionally, watch out for phrases like \"these are outweighed by the disadvantages,\" where \"these\" can be more explicitly stated as \"the advantages\" for clarity.\n\n5. **Supporting Your Views with Clear Examples**: You've provided examples, but making them more specific and directly linked to your arguments will strengthen your essay. Whenever possible, include real-life scenarios or statistics that solidify your stance.\n\n6. **Conclusion Clarity**: In your conclusion, ensure you succinctly recap the advantages and disadvantages discussed, clearly stating your position based on these arguments.

Communication and quick information.","essay_text":"As technology has become well-developed, the internet has brought numerous convenience to our lives. Although some people argue that these alterations will have detrimental effects, I believe that the benefits of such invention far outweigh its drawbacks. In this essay, there are two main reasons that I will explain why I think this way. \\n One advantage is that internet has revolutionised the way of communication. In the past, mail deliveries needed to rely on postmen and citizens had to wait for a couple of days before receiving mails, not to mention the messages sent from abroad. In modern times, however, with various online chat applications (such as WhatsApp, Line, etc.) being developed, residents are available to communicate immediately. In addition, internet has diminished the impact of geographical distance. This significantly helps people who suffer from long-distance relationships to keep their updates and feel a sense of affection without any delays through either online messages or video chats. \\n Obtaining a vast amount of information within few minutes is another benefit of the internet. Hundreds of thousands online resources can be easily assessed at a click of a button rather than wasting a substantial period of time on searching library shelves. Admittedly, a few educationalists will argue that not all of online information is reliable as some may have inappropriate and misunderstanding content. Nonetheless, I truly think that if we know how to identify and select suitable online materials , it undoubtedly results in saving more time and efforts. \\n In conclusion, as I stated above, I firmly believe that the internet have had more positive impacts on our lives. This is because of its influence on the evolution of communication and information searching methods, leading to a cost-effective and advantageous society.","human_feedback_text":"Aside from a slight discussion deviation, you were able to defend your opinion very well. Also, you should have used a synonym for \"the internet\" because that is still a direct keyword from the original presentation. Synonyms for \"the internet\" include cyberspace, world wide web, hyperspace, information superhighway, and online network. It is important to use synonyms in the essay to highlight your lexical resources in relation to the given topic. \\n Your response to the prompt requirement is not developed in accordance with the question posed. The question was: \\n <em>What are your opinion on this?<\/em> \\n Based on the opinion: \\n ... <em>the overall effect of this technology has been positive<\/em> \\n You changed the discussion direction by responding: \\n <em>I believe that the benefits of such invention far outweigh its drawbacks. In this essay, there are two main reasons that I will explain why I think this way.<\/em> \\n This is an opinion essay based on a specific statement given in the discussion prompt.

The proper response would have been: \\n <em>I believe that the existence of cyberspace in the everyday activities of people provides a beneficial influence. I base this opinion on 2 factors which will be discussed below.<\/em> \\n Try not to alter the prompt response in the paraphrase so that you will not lose points in the TA section. Avoid using parenthesis in the essay. Always use full sentences and do not use \"etc.\" in the presentation because this is an academic essay.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay presents a well-structured argument supporting the positive impacts of technology, specifically the internet, on our lives, focusing notably on communication and information accessibility. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance its coherence, adherence to the topic, and linguistic range.\n\n1. **Topic Response**: The essay slightly deviates from responding directly to the posed question. When addressing a specific opinion prompt, it's crucial to directly reflect the statement given, without altering its intent. Rather than indicating a broad comparison of benefits and drawbacks, focus on affirming the positive aspects as the prompt suggests. A more aligned response would explicitly state how the technology positively influences daily activities, without shifting the conversation towards its potential negative implications.\n\n2. **Synonyms and Lexical Resource**: Repeated use of key terms, such as \"the internet,\" can limit the demonstration of your lexical range. Introducing synonyms like \"cyberspace,\" \"world wide web,\" or \"online network\" showcases your vocabulary diversity. This not only adheres to academic writing standards but also enriches your essay qualitatively.\n\n3. **Clarity and Style**: While the essay\u2019s points are clear, the presentation could be enhanced by avoiding abbreviations and parentheses. Academic writing demands full phrases and discourages the use of \"etc.\" This not only maintains formality but also ensures clarity in your arguments. \n\n4. **Spelling and Grammar**: Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and correct tense usage to maintain grammatical accuracy. For instance, \"the internet has brought\" is correctly stated, but be cautious with singular and plural forms elsewhere, such as in \"the internet have had.\"\n\n5. **Argument Development**: The essay benefits from clear and descriptive arguments that support the stated opinion. However, elaborating further on these arguments with examples or more detailed explanations could strengthen the essay. Consider discussing the transformative effect of the internet on specific aspects of daily life or industries to provide concrete evidence of its positive impact.\n\nTo sum up, focusing on directly addressing the essay prompt, expanding your vocabulary through synonym usage, adhering to formal academic writing conventions, and refining your grammatical accuracy, will significantly enhance your essay's effectiveness and coherence. Aim to provide clear, detailed support for your arguments to convincingly portray the merits of the subject at hand."}
{"source_url":"https:\/\/essayforum.com\/writing\/state-expenditure-art-89810\/","split":"train","essay_title":"The state's expenditure on art","essay_text":"People have diverse options about the state's expenditure on art. Some people argued that instead of squandering money on art organizations, governments should allocate taxpayers' money for the improvement of other basic necessities. While this thinking is valid to a certain extent, I believe that state funding of art is worth every penny. \\n There are some justifications given by people who oppose diverting funds towards arts. First of all, art is not considered to be essential, compared to other critical aspects of the sustainability of human's life. For example, state budgets should be spent on public services such as education, healthcare and infrastructure, which are vital for a country to function properly. In addition to this, it is argued that some art projects are self-sufficient in finance, for they can earn money from ticket sales and private investors. As a result, it is superfluous for government to allocate budget for the arts. \\n Despite the aforementioned drawbacks, I would content that art should be given the top priority. On the individual level, art has been regarded as the valuable supplement for humans' soul. For instance, art products enhance our spiritual lives by reducing psychological stress and bringing us great faith in promising future. On the social level, investment in arts is such a strategic way to boost the economy. Traditional arts, take local handicraft as an example, make a profound impression on international tourists, which facilitates the development of tourism industry. Therefore, it is indisputable that arts generate revenue in return. \\n In conclusion, it is clear to me that art expenditure is advantageous for both individuals and society, so funding arts by the government is not a wastage of money.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>While this thinking is valid to a certain extent, I believe that state funding of art is worth every penny.<\/quotation> \\n You are not supplying a proper extent response.

This is not a comparison essay. It is a single s discussion. Avoid making this mistake in the future to avoid severe penalties in your final score. You do not need to justify the opposing view, just convincingly support your opinion using valid reasons based on common knowledge or personal observations.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay presents a thoughtful discussion on the allocation of state funds towards the arts, comparing the necessity of funding arts with basic human needs like education and healthcare. However, there are some areas where your essay could be strengthened to better convey your arguments and ensure a clearer stance on the topic.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**:\n   Your essay adequately addresses the topic by evaluating both sides of the argument regarding state funding for the arts. However, your introduction of both perspectives might give an impression of a comparative essay rather than presenting a single, solid stance as required. Remember, the task seeks to understand your viewpoint explicitly; hence, it's essential to assert your position more strongly without allocating equal emphasis on the opposing view.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**:\n   There are minor spelling and grammatical mistakes noticed, such as the use of \"people have diverse options about\" which should be \"people have diverse opinions about\", and the usage of \"content\" that seems to be a typo for \"contend\". Moreover, try to avoid using general terms like \"art is worth every penny\" without specifying why or how. Clear, specific language will make your argument more persuasive. Be mindful of using simple and direct language for clarity and coherence.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Point of View**:\n   Your essay somewhat lacks a definitive stance that explicitly shows your full support for state funding of arts. To improve, consider defining your point of view more precisely in your thesis statement. For example, instead of saying \"I believe that state funding of art is worth every penny,\" specify why you believe so or to what extent, which could make your position clearer right from the beginning.\n\n4. **Argument Support**:\n   Your arguments in favor of funding the arts are insightful, discussing both individual and social benefits. However, you could enhance your essay by directly linking these benefits with why they justify state funding over other essentials without framing it as a comparative argument. Focus more on providing solid, standalone reasons that support your view on art funding, using specific examples or personal observations to reinforce your claims.\n\nIn summary, focusing on clarifying and reinforcing your stance without juxtaposing it unnecessarily against the opposing view can greatly enhance the effectiveness of your essay. Ensure your thesis statement directly reflects your opinion and back it up with clear, specific arguments. Additionally, pay attention to spelling, grammar, and the precision of your language for a more impactful essay."}

To a certain extent, I think private companies are capable of carrying out their own investigation. However, I agree that it could be more beneficial if the states are in charge of organizing those research. \\n From a business perspective, private companies have more motivation to invest in their research. They need evidence to show that their products or interventions could bring out the desired effects. The significant results from the company's findings could be the selling points of their products, which bring great profits for the company. As a result, private companies could gather a large amount of data, but they could also manipulate the data to benefit themselves. For example, a pharmaceutical company studying the effectiveness of the newly invented drug would never want to disseminate the results of their study if that drug does not work. They could possibly adjust the findings to make them more favorable. \\n As there is a considerable risk of bias from private companies' research, I think the data quality could be better assured if the governments initiate those research. The states have fewer conflicts of interest that individual company. However, the governments have many focuses including economics, society, health, environment and more. If the research interest is not within the authorities' top priorities, it would take a long time for the research proposal to be approved and implemented. But once the researches are conducted, the findings will bring great benefits for the community and will help to inform the development of policy. \\n In conclusion, I believe that government-sponsored scientific studies, rather than those conducted by private companies, can better ensure the quality of evidence and better inform policy-makers.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>To a certain extent,<\/quotation> \\n <quotation>However, I agree that<\/quotation> \\n You have provided a response sentence for 2 different discussion prompts in the task 2 essay.

The argument developed presents a view that government sponsorship of scientific studies is preferable to those conducted by private companies for quality assurance and informing policy. This response is aligned with the essay topic, but there's a need for clarity in presenting the thesis statement.\n\nThe opening statement introduces two perspectives without clearly establishing the essay's stance. It's crucial to present a single, coherent response to the essay prompt. Instead of starting with phrases that may seem to address separate discussions, such as \u201cTo a certain extent\u201d and \u201cHowever, I agree that,\u201d aim for a direct approach that reflects a clear understanding of the question. This will help in articulating the central argument without confusion, ensuring the essay is focused and concise from the beginning.\n\nThere are minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues noted. For instance, when referring to \u201cthose research,\u201d the correct term would be \u201cthose research studies\u201d or \u201cthat research.\u201d It's also important to maintain consistency in subject-verb agreement and choose the appropriate plurality for nouns.\n\nThe perspective of the essay author is evident but could be made stronger with a more decisive thesis statement early in the essay. Presenting the argument as a personal belief right from the start would solidify the author's viewpoint.\n\nThe essay benefits from clear and descriptive arguments that support the author's position. The discussion about private companies potentially manipulating data for their benefit contrasts effectively with the argument for government-led research. However, these arguments could be enhanced by including specific examples or further elaborating on how exactly government research brings benefits to the community and informs policy development.\n\nTo improve, consider revising the opening statement for clarity and directness, correcting minor grammatical issues, and further developing arguments with additional support or examples. These adjustments will strengthen the essay, making the author's point of view clearer and the supporting arguments more compelling.\n\nLastly, it's helpful to rephrase ideas and statements correctly to match the intent of the essay prompt and avoid misinterpretation.

However, this belief apparently ignores that the society is much more complex than we think and it may cause those who are not mature enough to be deceived when they have no parents around them. Thus it is fair to conclude that it is better to live with parents for a longer time. \\n First of all, our parents definitely have a lot more knowledge and experiences than us, which means we can always learn from them while we live together.

And always can I hear that my sister ask my parents for some issues happened in her company. And hardly cannot my parents solve her problems, which, I think, totally help my sister's career life. However, people who have already left their parents cannot easily find someone experienced enough for the guidance. \\n In addition, family member especially parents are the most significant relations in one's life.

Although I acknowledge that the use of fossil fuels may result in some advantages, I contend that we can reap substantial dividends from the implementation of renewable energy. \\n undoubtedly, proponents of fossil fuel usage might believe that such practice is an affordable approach. Indeed, one of the greatest impediments to the installation of equipment such as solar panels is its unaffordability. By nature, the initial cost for installing equipment harnessing alternative energy is relatively prohibitive, putting financial burden on the governments, organizations and households. Therefore, the wide availability and cost-effectiveness of fossil fuels act as a strong incentive for people to employ it. This will significantly reduce pressure put on the government budget, facilitating investment in other equally essential sectors, such as education, healthcare or employment. For example, gasoline is used at a reasonable price in power turbines to generate electricity, providing enough electricity for households to use. Nonetheless, while the uplifting power of fossil fuels can not be understated, it is vital to admit its insurmountable impacts on the ecosystem, and neglecting it can lead to dire repercussions, which is why alternatives should be utilized to prevent these impacts from aggravating. \\n Notwithstanding these aforementioned contentions, I am of the conviction that alternative natural resources deserve utmost priority over fossil fuels. Firstly, the overuse of fossil fuels produces a great deal of CO2, leading to atmospheric contamination, which not only results in the loss of biodiversity but also leads to humans' health impairment, while alternative resources can contribute significantly to environmental preservation. For example, were it not for the introduction of solar power which harnesses the sun's rays to produce energy without discharging harmful pollutants, electricity and warm water would frequently be generated by burning fossil fuels. Therefore, the utilization of alternative resources can culminate in the mitigation of environmental degradation, guaranteeing a consistent provision of environmentally-friendly and dependable supply. Secondly, the allocation of natural resources can provide a stimulus to sustainable development. Unlike fossil fuels, which may soon be depleted and take millions of years to replenish due to excessive exploitation, natural energies are renewable resources and never run out, bringing about long-term benefits for society. Particularly, wind power has been utilized effectively to convert wind into electrical power, encouraging the reduction of reliance on fossil fuels, fostering sustainable development goals. \\n In conclusion, I concede that although there may be certain beneficial outcomes that can be derived from using fossil fuels, it would be more advantageous if we capitalized on alternative environmentally-friendly resources.","human_feedback_text":"This is another overwritten essay that will definitely not be completed within 40 minutes.

In my perspective, the aforementioned opinion is reasonable, and the free-college policy would have a beneficial impact on the undergraduates and the community. \\n All students should be allowed to attend tertiary education because being a bachelor's degree holder will make it easier for graduates to find a job in the era of a competitive job marketing environment. Employers, these days, tend to be more attracted by well-educated job seekers because they believe that these employees have better time-management skills and the ability to work under high pressure. This can be exemplified in the case of Google, where employees with valuable tertiary degrees have a higher performance at work and a higher salary than those only following a 12th-grade program. As a result, university graduates will have a better quality of life, not only being able to afford essential needs but also having opportunities to save a certain amount of money for future unexpected expenses. \\n There are two compelling reasons why the government should make tuition free for students regardless of the financial status of their families. One reason is that more students, especially the underprivileged, would have an opportunity to follow higher-level education thanks to this policy. In several parts of the world such as Ha Giang Province (Viet Nam) where poverty is still a monumental issue, many families cannot make ends meet, let alone pay tuition fees for their children. By abolishing tuition, high-school graduates can continue their education, instead of staying at home, working on the farm, and getting married at a young age. Moreover, the free-of-charge policy can give rise to a more educated workforce, which eventually results in a thriving economy. To put it simply, an economy with high-level workers would have a higher manufacturing efficiency than one with a lower rate of well-educated labor. For instance, Germany, a country with 87% of individuals with tertiary qualifications is more developed than those countries in Africa with the lower proportion of the population being educated. \\n In conclusion, I completely agree that students from different family financial statuses should be allowed to attend university with government subsidies.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>It is argued<\/quotation> \\n Avoid the use of memorized phrases in your writing exercises.

However, there are important areas that can be improved to enhance the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of your writing.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay addresses the topic directly and maintains a consistent focus on arguing for government-funded higher education. However, to strengthen your position from the beginning, it\u2019s advisable to clearly state your opinion in the introduction without relying on generic phrases like \"It is argued.\" Consider clarifying your stance with specific, original language that directly responds to the essay prompt. This approach will help in reinforcing your argument right from the start.\n\n2. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer thesis statement early on. Rather than saving your clear opinion for the conclusion or embedding it in less direct language, explicitly state your viewpoint in both the introduction and the conclusion. This will not only meet the essay requirements but also guide your readers through your arguments more effectively.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are no significant spelling issues, but careful attention to sentence structure and the avoidance of overly complex or memorized phrases will improve the readability and authenticity of your essay. Aim for simplicity and clarity in your language to ensure your ideas are accessible to all readers.\n\n4. **Arguments and Supporting Evidence**: You effectively use examples and reasons to support your viewpoint.

Decades ago, however, it would be fixed and used for a longer time.

Firstly, the increase in disposable income over the years has enabled individuals to afford new commodity. Meanwhile, the prices of goods have been dramatically reduced, thanks to scale production and cheaper man-made material such as plastics and nylon. With the availability of relatively inexpensive products, less people would bother to wait for hours or even days to have things repaired, especially in the modern society where the pace of living is incredibly fast. \\n This change in attitude has produced harmful consequences. On the one hand, a huge amount of waste is generated every day, with a large portion that cannot be reused or recycled. Some of them go to the landfills while others are burnt away, causing soil and air contamination. On the other hand, factories are producing new products at their full capacity to feed the growing need, depleting scarce resources. Waste pollution and resource exploitation might eventually lead us to a deadly environmental crisis. \\n In summary, it is true that instead of using the repaired old item, most people would rather replace it with a new one.

People have the same occasion to having a job, not depends on the sex as long as they have good skill in that job. For example, hitherto, a man can become a barber in women's barber shop because he has a great skill in cutting hair and making an amazing female hair's style. It is totally different with few years ago which is male cannot take that job because of the different sex. At that time, it might be the ancient people think male will damage women's hair, hence they do not allow cutting the women's hair. \\n Subsequently, someone's success is not based on the genders. If people give the big effort to get something, they could take it all. Moreover, skill can be created by giving training for the people. For instance, females could be more success in repairing of a car than males as women have the high automotive skill. Although the automotive job is a men job, it does not mean that women cannot do it also.

Thus they would be able to find the best deals. Beside that, advertising also acts as a form of entertainment. Since there is a growing competitiveness between brands, companies are trying to boost their attractiveness by applying entertaining effects on ads to catch consumers' attention. Thus, viewers are more likely to enjoy advertisements to unwind and lift their mood up. For example, while getting stressed from online study, I am often able to release my stress by running into adverts with engaging songs and singing along. \\n In terms of producers, advertising does bring them a couple of benefits. Firstly, advertising means closer approaches to buyers which in turn increases sales and profits. Consequently, this not only does good to companies but also helps shape a stronger economy. Secondly, as the process of promoting products requires a lot of labor, it would lead to higher recruitment for jobs. For instance, because the advertising industry, these days, is on a dramatic development to meet demands for products than ever before, various job positions such as copywriter or illustrator are overflowing on the job market with lucrative salaries.

According to the recent studies which conducted in the US and some European countries in 2015, only 20% of pupples who get sleep enough. While 80% do not have sufficient sleep or even stay up until the go to school on the next day. Another decisive point is the teacher`s performance.

The task required a focus on specific reasons for children's concentration issues in school and how to resolve them. Instead, the essay ventured into discussing the broader issue of different sides of a debate not directly requested by the prompt.

For example, \"a quite difficult to children to concentrate\" should be corrected to \"it is quite difficult for children to concentrate.\" Also, phrases like \"a plethora number of people\" should be revised to \"a plethora of people\" or \"a large number of people.\" Work on sentence structure to ensure clarity and coherence in your essay.

However, the value of books remains irreplaceable, serving as individuals' companions that enlighten, inspire, and empower them on their life journey of learning and self-discovery. \\n Firstly, the more you read, the more you know. Since books are a rich source of information on diverse topics, engaging with books can provide students with access to a wide range of subjects, from history and science to philosophy and literature, which not only fosters continuous learning but also expands their knowledge base. \\n Furthermore, books can stimulate readers' imagination by allowing them to visualize characters, settings, and scenarios. They encourage creative thinking and provide a platform for exploring new ideas and perspectives. For instance, sci-fi books let readers immerse themselves in the lives and experiences of various characters by following their journeys, understanding their emotions, and empathizing with their challenges. \\n To conclude, the cons of reading books are invaluable and undeniable. Beyond being a source of entertainment, books serve as catalysts for personal growth in general and intellectual development, emotional enrichment in particular.

However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make your argument stronger and more directly related to the topic.\n\nFirstly, the introduction slightly misses the target by not explicitly tying the importance of books to the context of today\u2019s technological advancements. Instead of a broad statement about technology overshadowing books, consider mentioning the specific context of e-books versus printed books. This will make your introduction more relevant to the topic and clarify that the method of reading (whether electronic or paper) isn't the focus, but rather the act of reading itself is what's important.\n\nSecondly, there's a small but significant error in your conclusion. You've used the term \"cons\" which suggests negative aspects, when in fact, you are discussing the positive impacts or \"pros\" of reading books. This is an important distinction because it changes the meaning of your argument.

However, I firmly believe that publicize criminals' identity more persuasive as it could protect our community. \\n To begin with, protecting offenders' personal information helps their families not to be discriminated against and unequally treated in society. In addition, this could highly victimize the criminals' families as people predispose to stay away from relatives who have relationships with them. For instance, research in a British university conducted by prominent professors indicated that a significantly high number of individuals who have relationships with criminals suicided due to stress and strains they endured from the discrimination of their society. \\n On top of that, many people believe that revealing the identities of criminals publicly encourage people to be aware of the pervasive threats around them. Moreover, making civilians acknowledge notorious criminals' information helps them to stay away from offenders, prepare better plans or self-protect tools and consequently reduce crime cases. For example, research in Vietnam was conducted to observe the changes in the community after a publishment of a government policy which is to require the national media to publicize the criminals' personal information. It pointed a fact that the crime rate has dwindled substantially and most citizens have raised their awareness towards crimes. \\n In conclusion, it would be a righteous way to keep the offenders' identities secret in order to eradicate the discrimination rate towards innocent people such as their relatives.

As a result, youngsters generously open their hearts for strangers who may instill unsuitable opinions into them, taken to a ride that redirects them into believing those are the best relationships they could ever get, creating distant with real-life friends and family. \\n To cope with this, we need cooperation from both the families and the governments. Firstly, parents could encourage their children to take part in recreational extracurriculum in-person activities, strengthening the family bonds to deter them from immersing in the virtual world. For example, having a picnic or setting off for a journey together can help members to understand the other more, while being detached from the Internet to enjoy the real-life contentment. This will make the young acknowledging the importance and indispensability of families and friends. Secondly, the governments could impose public policies to put pressures and restriction on the giants in technology field, forcing them to create a more constructive online environment, preventing children from being leaded on wrong paths. \\n In conclusion, the issue is attributed from a variety of reasons, ranged from homehold scale to the whole nation, requiring a comprehensive adjustment to amend and improve the current situation, leading teenagers to a brighter future while also contributing to the progress of society.","human_feedback_text":"The essay is overwritten.

A huge part of cheerleading is stunting. A stunt is a moved performed by a group of people the group consists of a flyer, two bases, a back spot, and sometimes a front spot. A flyer is the person being put in the air, the bases are lifting her, the spots watch the flyer to make sure she doesn't fall and sometimes helps out with the stunt.

Expect the possible questions and immediately cut their possible opposition by informing the listeners about those possible questions through your expanded discussions. Have someone read what you have written and ask that person if he has any questions about cheerleading being a sport after reading your debate essay.

Bear in mind that a strong debate stance is one that doesn't allow the opposition a chance to proceed with their own debate because you preempted their discussion already. .","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"This essay effectively addresses the topic by arguing that competitive cheerleading qualifies as a sport, guided by the criteria that define a sport. The presentation of cheerleading as a physical activity involving skill and competition, as well as governed by specific rules, builds a strong argument in favor of its status as a sport. The detailed explanation of the elements and types of competitions in cheerleading enriches the essay, offering readers a clear understanding of the complexities and demands of this activity.\n\nHowever, the essay predominantly focuses on supporting the argument that cheerleading is a sport without thoroughly considering or refuting opposing viewpoints.

Although some politicians claim that economic growth is undoubtedly most essential, I believe that other issues could be more crucial to our homeland and therefore deserve our attention. \\n On the one hand, economic progress is pivotal to the success of a country. With thriving markets and advancing economy, the government can secure reliable tax funds for supporting projects of infrastructure and public services, providing good standards of living to citizens. For example, in highly-developed countries, such as USA, the UK, Japan etc., people not only lead a rich and comfortable life but also have better education and welfare systems than those in the impoverished areas of the world. Furthermore, a nation with strong economy can come to prominence on the global stage, exerting its political influence and trade power. \\n However, although many wealthy countries already have gained great economic success, yet their people are still suffering from a variety of social and environmental crises. Even in advanced regions, racial and sexual discrimination, industrial pollution and political corruption are widespread nowadays. Economic progress should not be the only vision of governments.

How well the governments preserve our natural environment and how they value opinions from several minority groups will benefit not only us but also our next generations. \\n In conclusion, upholding economic development is indispensable duty of our government, but not the sole central task they should focus on.

The prompt asks you to discuss others' views and your own opinion, suggesting a contrast between public opinions and personal belief. However, your essay frames the discussion primarily from your personal perspective right from the start.

While a variety of factors may lead to this trend, in my opinion, this development would be beneficial for both travelers and the host countries which receive them. \\n Personally, three main factors are to blame for the growth of international travel nowadays. Firstly, growing prosperity and a rise in living standards in many countries have made travel abroad affordable for almost every member of society. The higher income and the more spare time workers have, the more frequent chance they would make to visit exotic destinations. Secondly, due to the considerable establishment of new tour operators, competition among them has reduced the cost of traveling. Finally, in some countries, governments have imposed more policies to attract foreign tourists, and therefore, holidaymakers have greater opportunities to travel. \\n In my view, there are undoubtedly advantages for both travelers and the host countries in terms of international travel. On the one hand, there is ever-greater competition among tour agency, so that holidaymakers can enjoy their experience of foreign country and culture to the full and have the minimum of travel expenses. On the other hand, the influx of foreign tourists brings money to the host countries through the provision of jobs and the growth of hospitalities such as restaurants and hotels. Employees in these sectors may benefit from higher wages and living standards, too. At the same time, host tourism could also receive investment opportunities from wealthy investors, and this means that there is an obvious positive development of local economies and businesses. \\n In conclusion, I believe that the development of international tourism has brought far more benefits to travelers and host countries. \\n (285 words)","human_feedback_text":"The prompt restatement requires you to deliver a clear outline pattern for your discussion based on the two questions being asked: \\n - Why are more people traveling to other countries?

That is the first step towards properly writing the response to the essay. You need to consider all possible responses to the questions provided and then, decide which side you will support and what idea you will discuss that will best support your response to the question. When you brainstorm, you avoid the common pitfalls of response writing which are : \\n - under developed explanations ( as seen in your first reasoning paragraph) \\n - unrelated information discussion which leads to a lack of coherence and cohesiveness in the discussion ( second reasoning paragraph error) \\n To be specific, your first reasoning paragraph did very well in explaining the financial aspect of travel. Even the example used was solid and helped to deliver a clear and properly developed explanation. Then, you decided to throw in a second reason, which did not blend well with the first given discussion and also, was not well explained nor supported with examples. Hence the under developed discussion \\n The second reasoning paragraph was supposed to help explain why you see this as a positive development based on the growing prosperity and rise in living standards of the tourist.

The essay outlines several reasons for the increase in international travel and provides arguments for the benefits of this development for both travelers and host countries. However, there are areas where the essay could be significantly improved to meet the requirements of the task more effectively and to enhance overall coherence and clarity.\n\nFirstly, the essay would benefit from a clearer structure in responding directly to the questions posed. The introduction should succinctly state the main reason for the increase in international travel, focusing on one primary cause such as growing prosperity and rising living standards. It should also clearly take a stance on whether this trend is considered positive or negative, thus providing a clearer outline for the discussion that follows.\n\nThe body paragraphs need a focus to ensure that each one supports the thesis stated in the introduction. The first reasoning paragraph excellently identifies financial accessibility as a contributing factor to the increase in international travel. However, introducing a second reason without fully integrating it with the overall argument detracts from the essay's coherence. It would be more effective to expand on how growing prosperity enables more people to travel, perhaps by incorporating examples or further details, rather than introducing new, less-developed points.\n\nThe second body paragraph should also be closely aligned with the essay's main argument. While it attempts to discuss the benefits of international travel, the shift towards benefits for host countries, rather than focusing on how the initial reasoning (growing prosperity and rise in living standards) influences travelers\u2019 perspectives and experiences, creates a disconnect. Strengthening the connection between travelers' increased prosperity and the positive outcomes of their travel would improve the essay\u2019s coherence.\n\nOn a stylistic note, the essay is generally well-written but suffers from occasional grammatical errors and could benefit from more varied sentence structures to enhance readability. Paying attention to these issues will not only improve the fluency of the essay but also make the arguments more compelling.\n\nIn conclusion, while the essay successfully identifies key trends and benefits associated with international travel, refining the structure to provide a more direct response to the questions, ensuring coherence between paragraphs, and addressing minor grammatical issues would greatly enhance its effectiveness. Focusing on these aspects would make the arguments clearer and more persuasive, ultimately resulting in a stronger essay."}

First of all, government should encourage power stations and plant using environmentally friendly energy sources such as nuclear or renewable energy instead of fossil fuels to decline the emission released to the air every day. Secondly, the strict punishment should be imposed for illegal logging and forest clearance to prevent humans from cutting forests for the personal benefits and make sure that forest areas are protected and managed properly.

It seems you believe increased parental involvement could address both the issues of freedom and media influence. Dedicating a paragraph to discuss how and why increased parental supervision could be effective, including potential methods and outcomes, would make your argument more robust and coherent.\n\nAdditionally, pay attention to grammatical accuracy and the use of specific, descriptive language. Avoiding generalizations and being more precise in your language can help clarify your points. For example, explaining exactly how media influence or parental absence contributes to youth crime would be beneficial.\n\nIn terms of essay structure, you clearly stated your intention in the introductory paragraph and attempted to follow through in the body paragraphs before concluding. This is a good structure. However, ensure each section is fully fleshed out with clear, developed ideas. \n\nIn conclusion, your essay has a strong foundation and addresses an important topic. Improving the clarity and development of your arguments, being mindful of language use, and focusing on detailed and expanded solutions would enhance your essay. Remember, specific examples and evidence can significantly support your position, making your argument more persuasive. Keep working on your writing, and you'll continue to make progress!"}

I totally agree with this view. \\n On the one hand, the Internet certainly provides us with geographically unconstrained connection and communication. There is a wide range of smart devices which enable users to update the status of their friends, family, relatives wherever they are such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, or even smartwatches. Today, with only an iPhone connected to the Internet and installed Skype, a person in Vietnam can easily make a video call with their friends in America with no fee. The development of social media like Facebook or Twitter is also a key factor that makes the connection between each other more convenient. On social media, we can add new friends to our friend lists and chat with them, follow famous figures, or share our feelings daily, etc. \\n On the other hand, using the Internet improperly can bring negative effects on users and discourage them to participate in social activities. Because everything can be done online so users may become embarrassed or even afraid of having to communicate or share feelings with others directly. For instance, we can leave comments on our relatives' pictures on Twitter to ask about our current status rather than visiting them. Nevertheless, attractive things on the Internet such as computer games or movies make people addicted to the Internet and spend most of their time online so that there is no time left for other activities in their real life. For example, a young girl can spend almost all day watching short videos on TikTok, so she does not have any time to talk with their parents. \\n In conclusion, the Internet brings about both merits and demerits. In my perspective, the key answer is that how to use this great invention of humans in the right way to balance our time online and offline.","human_feedback_text":"This is a one- sided opinion essay.

However, to elevate the quality and adherence to the essay prompt, several improvements are recommended.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**:\nThe essay captures the essence of the topic by discussing the dual nature of the Internet\u2019s influence on society. Yet, it would benefit from a stronger, singular standpoint as suggested by the essay's requirements. Instead of dividing the essay into contrasting viewpoints, focus more on providing two clear, supportive arguments that align closely with the chosen perspective.

Additionally, avoiding phrases like \"it is supposed that although\" for simpler alternatives such as \"although\" at the beginning would refine the stylistic approach.\n\n3. **Clearness of Point of View**:\nThe essay initially presents a clear viewpoint agreeing that the Internet, despite its connectivity, isolates people.

However, refining the focus to consistently support the initial agreement\u2014that the Internet isolates\u2014would align better with the essay's requirements. It's beneficial to expand on how these examples exclusively support the thesis without presenting contrasting views unless directly supporting the main argument.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\nThe conclusion introduces a new dimension about balancing online and offline time, which, while insightful, diverges from summarizing the previously presented arguments. A more effective conclusion would reiterate the main points supporting the thesis, reinforcing the initial stance without introducing new ideas.\n\nBy concentrating on providing a clear, consistent stance throughout and ensuring the conclusion succinctly encapsulates the essay's arguments, the writing will not only adhere more closely to the prompt but also present a more compelling and cohesive analysis.

Reason? Measures?","essay_text":"It is true that children have been spending a whole time watching TV programs instead of engaging in social and outdoor activities. In this essay, I would outline a number of reasons why this problem arises and provides some proper measures to alleviate this issue. \\n The reasons for this problem can be found in the home and the development of means of entertainment. To begin with, children's personality and ability can be shaped during the formative years living with their family. However, parents who lay the foundation of one's child development nowadays are not only too engaged in their own business but also scared of children playing outside, which leads to a passive habit of children\/ lack of children's social activities and interpersonal skills. For example, parents who usually spend at least 8 hours at their office to make a living are unable to monitor their kid's behaviour and activities at home, leading to unhealthy life of teenagers such as television, computer in bedroom, physical inactivity. On top of that, youngsters fall victim of a live telecast due to the proliferation of television channels. Compared to the past when most TV channels were black and white, and were limited with several programs, hundreds of channels with high-resolution graphics are nowadays available to attract potential customers like children. \\n However, in order to solve this problem, parents should take steps to diminish the amount of time children following television incorporate with encouraging their teenagers participating in outdoor activities. Firstly, parent's guidance is essential since they can restrict the children's excessive exposure to means of entertainment such as film and video games. This is not only protecting children from being addicted to the electronic media but also is of great benefit to youngsters in nurturing childhood development. Moreover, essential life skills should be developed through some challenging programs such as team building, mountain-climbing. By putting children to the test, family and school give children opportunities to achieve an outstanding performance in outdoor activities. \\n In conclusion, although there are several factors which cause children's passive habit of watching movie more than ever before, there are proper measures in which children should be guided and encouraged to be more active.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>It is true that children have been spending a whole time watching TV<\/quotation> \\n - This is a factual claim.

However, there are several areas that can be improved to make the essay more effective and compelling.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay responds to the topic but can be strengthened by backing up claims with data or evidence. For instance, the opening statement makes a broad claim about children's habits. To make arguments more convincing, try to include evidence or examples that support these claims. This could be references to studies, statistics, or credible observations that show this trend among children.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** The essay generally follows acceptable spelling and grammar rules, but there are instances where sentences could be clearer. Writing can be made more direct and impactful by avoiding long and unspecific phrases. For example, sentences beginning with \"To begin with,\" \"However,\" and \"In conclusion,\" could be more straightforward without these fillers. Also, watch out for run-on sentences or phrases that make the essay harder to follow. Breaking down complex ideas into simpler, separate sentences can help clarity.\n\n3. **Clear Point of View:** The essay does present a clear point of view, arguing that the sedentary lifestyle of children watching TV is a problem and suggesting parental involvement as a solution. Enhance this by regularly reminding the reader of your main point in each paragraph, ensuring the essay remains focused and persuasive.\n\n4. **Descriptive Arguments:** The essay includes reasons for the problem and solutions, which is good. However, it can be improved by offering more detailed examples, and possibly, quantifiable evidence to support these points. When discussing parents' roles or proposing activities like mountain-climbing, describing specific benefits or outcomes can make the argument more compelling. Instead of general statements, detailing how these activities can improve children's social skills or physical health would strengthen the essay.\n\nIn summary, focusing on providing evidence for claims, simplifying language for clarity, steering clear of filler phrases, and elaborating on arguments with specific examples can greatly enhance the essay's effectiveness. By refining these areas, the essay will not only be more aligned with scoring considerations but also more engaging and persuasive to readers."}

This happens when all wild animals exist, human could understand each of this species' behaviour and the interaction to their kin, in which they can eventually exploit that insight to solve people's problems. A lion, the beast wild animals living in Forest, very often successfully catches their prey by working in a group, for example. Such behaviour could teach human about the advantage of solving problem together when being confronted with complex issue. Therefore, through conservation area, all of these wild animals could sustain their lives. \\n However, the opposite would argue that society should exclude certain wild animals, posing threat to human's lives. That is to say that, unlike the species of wild herbivore having no interest to injure human or sometimes avoiding people to save their lives, the wild beast such as tiger considers human as their prey and potentially kill them due to its nature as a carnivore. Eventually, society would live under the fear of unwanted attack from such animals. A Local News in India reported that the male tiger from deep forest, entering the small village at night, killed the boy. Such incident occurred when the boy walked and suddenly the tiger pounced this boy from behind. Thus, there would be no use of protecting such animals due to its threat to human. \\n In conclusion, I think that preserving all wild animals would be necessary, since there will be much useful insight being discovered once people study about their lives.

Thus, all we need is stringent measures to encourage citizens to get involved in this attempt. However, I personally disagree with this initiative issue since the role of education is more essential in order to engage people recycling the garbage. \\n It is often believed that the power of laws can drive citizens to obey desired attitudes in the society. This is because whoever neglects the rules will be punished, either by paying fines or putting in the jail. For instance, a car driver passing 3 in 1 lines has to ensure that he picks up at least 3 passengers. If they do not so, they are going to be prisoned or to pay $3,000. However, it is undeniable that office workers who are in a hurry hire others to accompany them during the journey. Clearly, establishing an official obligation is not effective to encourage citizens in the term of recycling process. \\n Educated young people about environmental science in the formal institution is a worth idea to raise awareness of the importance of recycling. As a matter of fact, students will realize why it is significant to modify old things, and they can learn how to reuse those. In addition, students who are going to be adults in the immediate future will bring the household rubbish to the recycling centre without any force, having their own initiatives. Furthermore, young people can introduce this way to other family members. \\n To sum up, the majority of people think that official statements have affords to tackle the recycling problem. Meanwhile I have a tendency to think that it is better to educate young people because they will bring greater impacts on the environment. Hopefully, citizens are going to welcome this idea.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, the prompt is asking you about laws regarding the implementation of recycling in communities.

I personally believe that producers shall not take on the responsibility regarding over packaging and the consumers should continue buying this type of product. Therefore, I will be pleased to discuss two reasons behind this belief and then support them with my personal examples. \\n First of all, most of packages these days are recyclable, therefore there is no point to stop purchasing overly packaged products. This is not at all surprising, considering that an increasing number of individual people attempt to promote sustainability; consequently, most packages can be recycled anyway. For example, when I walk into my grocery stores, most of the items that I end up purchasing always has a recycling symbol on them. \\n Apart from products being recyclable, by over packaging a certain product, it will most likely be well protected which is what most consumers are looking for; no one wants their products to become defective due to lack of packaging. This is especially important to picky, detailed customers as most of them expect the products to be perfect and be delivered safely to their homes. For example, I always end up with defective items as the manufacturer does not package their products properly. \\n Having discussed the importance of over packaging products, it can be concluded that both consumers and producers should not be against overly packaged products as they are recyclable and well protected. Consequently, I disagree with the statement above.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, you seem to have gotten a bit confused in your opening statement. You were unclear about simply having a package wrapped in recyclable materials as opposed to packages overwrapped for consumers. If you review the original prompt, there was no indication that the packages being mentioned were in recyclable wrapping. Yet your essay is solely focused on recycled, overwrapped products. You changed the prompt for the discussion. Since the focus of your essay is more on recycled products being overwrapped instead of simply overwrapped products, your answer will be considered selective in discussion topic and response. That means, you will get a lower than average score because of a certain degree of prompt deviation on your part. \\n An example of an overwrapped product are athletic shoes. Consider how the item is wrapped. There is shrink plastic wrapping the box. The box is then shielded with clear paper on top. The shoes (in some instances) are inside a reusable bag inside the box. When you take the shoes out of the bag, the shoes itself are even contained in shape retaining holders then the shoes are filled with contouring cardboards in order to keep the shape of the foot opening. That is an example of an overwrapped product. Sure the materials used are recyclable, that isn't the issue. The is the fact that before you can even get to the actual product, you have to go through way too much packaging which, as you said is not environmentally friendly. \\n Now, consider the case of fresh eggs. Eggs are not impact resistant and break if you even so much as place something heavy on top of the egg holder. Yet the eggs are only packaged in either plastic or cardboard containers that do very little to protect it. Shouldn't the producer bear responsibility for the packaging of this breakable item? The shoes aren't going to break and yet it is overprotected in packing. The egg, which breaks easily and has an important function in the sustenance of man, is given inferior packaging. Do you see where I am headed at here? Yes. You misunderstood the prompt to a certain degree. \\n Consider the types of products sold in overwrapped packaging.

The prompt asks whether consumers should avoid over-packaged products or if it's the producer's responsibility to reduce packaging. A more direct approach to this question, considering both recyclable and non-recyclable packaging, would make the essay more relevant to the given topic. It's important to address the core issue of whether the amount of packaging is necessary and who should take responsibility for it.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: Overall, the essay is well-written, but there are minor grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing that could be clarified. For example, \"most of packages these days are recyclable\" could be revised to \"most packages these days are recyclable\" for smoother reading. Additionally, sentences could be more concise to improve clarity and make the argument stronger.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View**: The author's viewpoint is clear; they believe consumers should not avoid over-packaged products because they're often recyclable and offer product protection. However, the argument could be strengthened by directly contrasting the responsibilities of consumers vs. producers, perhaps by considering examples of products that are unnecessarily over-packaged and discussing whether consumers or producers should address this issue.\n\n4. **Descriptive Arguments and Support**: While the essay provides personal examples to support arguments, it might benefit from a broader range of examples and a more detailed discussion on the impact of over-packaging beyond recyclability and product protection. For instance, examining the environmental cost of producing packaging materials\u2014even recyclable ones\u2014and discussing the responsibility of producers in choosing the amount and type of packaging could provide a more nuanced argument. Moreover, comparing over-packaged items (like athletic shoes as mentioned in the human feedback) with minimally packaged but fragile items (like eggs) could illustrate a more comprehensive view on when and why over-packaging is or isn't justified.\n\nTo enhance the essay, consider incorporating a comparative analysis of different products and their packaging needs, directly addressing the prompt's question about consumer and producer responsibilities. Also, refining the clarity and grammatical precision of the writing will strengthen the overall argument and make it more compelling to the reader."}

In order to tackle the problem, some suggest having more physical education in the student's system. While this might be helpful to some extent, I do not think this is an efficient solution. \\n First of all, while exercising is proven to be a beneficial method to lose weight, it needs to be paired with a balanced diet and changes in one's eating habit. In that perspective of linking eating habits with weight loss, not only school but also parents have to monitor and alter their children's behaviour when it comes to food. It is true for many people that binge eating relieves stress, hence it is necessary for parents to avoid putting too much strain on their children. Moreover, they could teach their children to deal with stress using numerous ways that do not include excessive eating like writing or listening to calm music. \\n Additionally, as a large number of people who are overweight do not belong in school, the change in the school schedule would be meaningless for them. A lot of them are office workers who lead stressful lives and spend countless hours sitting motionless in front of computers.

As a consequence, they are the main contributor of increasing pressure on the healthcare system. \\n In conclusion, the overweight situation cannot be improved by simply adding more physical education.

It appears to me that people should come forward to contribute to charity as it is easy to do as well as has other benefits too, which will be discussed in this essay. \\n For middle to high-class individuals and families, donating a fixed sum of their money should not be any issue. This is because they can easily create separate spaces in their monthly budgets for such assistance and then compare it with unnecessary expenses to decide whether they want to keep spending money for things like excessive alcohol, cigarettes, and junk\/processed food or simply wants to help the welfare organisations to pay it forward to the needy ones. Secondly, the kind act of charity also gives a sense of satisfaction as the donators are satisfied that they are also giving back to society in this particular form. Lastly, contributing to charity also comes with tax benefits in the form of 'tax-deduction free expenses' as governments around the world fix attractive limits for the same to attract the taxpayers to participate in such a noble cause. \\n It appears to be true that numerous earners are not very keen to the idea of donations. They seem to be concerned about factors like ever-increasing cost of living due to rising inflation rates around the globe. Nonetheless, same dynamics can be easily neutralized by managing expenses, and investing by taking calculated risks. \\n In summary, contributions to the welfare organizations should be made by earning individuals because as per my view it is easy to do so by limiting the materialistic expenses by small degrees, it also gives a sense of satisfaction, and lastly, it comes with tax benefits too.","human_feedback_text":"Keep the sentence presentations simple.

For clarity and proper formatting, avoid writing long sentences. Individual reference sentences always work best. \\n Since only the viewpoint is essential to the discussion, the benefits represent a prompt deviation. That section of writing is non-essential and therefore, non-scoring. The essay score will not meet the passing requirements as the actual discussion points, as required are not properly developed.

That is the only reason for the scoredown.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay addresses the topic by arguing that individuals should contribute to charity, citing reasons such as the financial capability of middle to high-class families, the personal satisfaction gained from donating, and the tax benefits associated with charitable contributions. While the essay's intention is clear and it takes a position on the importance of charity, there are several areas for improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and relevance to the topic at hand.\n\nFirstly, there's a need to simplify sentence structure and word usage. For example, \"so as the number of people who needs support from others\" could be more clearly stated as \"so too are the number of people needing support from others.\" Simplifying the language will help in making your points more straightforward and understandable. Long sentences can be broken down into shorter ones to avoid confusion and improve readability.\n\nThe essay sometimes diverts from the main topic by discussing the benefits of donating to charity, rather than focusing on the argument that people should donate more because of increased incomes and the growing need for charitable support. It is crucial to stay focused on the essay's main argument and develop it fully. The benefits of charity, although related, should support your main argument, not sidetrack it.\n\nMoreover, it's important to ensure that the arguments provided are relevant and directly support your viewpoint. The discussion on managing expenses and investing as a way to counteract concerns about inflation, for instance, feels somewhat tangential to the main argument about why people should donate to charity. Although these points are valid, they should be closely tied to the central argument to strengthen your essay's coherence and focus.\n\nAdditionally, grammatical errors, such as \"the kind act of charity also gives a sense of satisfaction as the donators are satisfied,\" should be corrected for clarity. This could be simplified to \"Donating to charity brings a sense of satisfaction.\" Paying attention to grammar and repetition will make your writing more professional and easier to understand.\n\nLastly, the point of view of the essay author is clear, but could be more persuasively presented with concrete examples or data to support the claims made, especially regarding the ease of donating and the benefits gained from doing so.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on simplifying the language, maintaining relevance and coherence, reducing grammatical errors, and strengthening arguments with supporting examples or data will significantly improve the quality of the essay."}

As youngsters are always in nerve when they want to try some new things, they tend to close their lives. Gradually, they do not have interest in communicating with others. To illustrate, I used to be punished for dropping soup when I was eating too fast, then I felt scary when I see that food again.

By installing software to detect employees' Internet use on company computers, we can prevent employees from wasting time, foster a better work ethic at Climpson, and improve our overall profits.\" \\n Write a response in which you examine the states and\/or unstated assumptions of the argument. \\n Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted. \\n My response: \\n The author's argument that the productivity of company employees is limited by their use of the Internet at their workstations is weakened by the inherent assumptions of that statement. The author assumes employees who use the Internet at their workstations are using it to spend time on non-work-related activities such as shopping or playing games. The employees could, in fact, be using the Internet to research solutions and resources to help them complete their work more quickly. The author assumes that by monitoring employees'' Internet use, the company can curb employees' time waste. The author's proposition does not account for the other ways that employees could be wasting time, including excessively frequent breaks or excessively long lunch and bathroom breaks. Employees could also be wasting company time while chatting with co-workers. The author's solution does not track these behaviors, meaning company time waste would not be prevented. The author also assumes that there exists a software capable of differentiating what activities the employees are using the Internet to carry out. Though the software may be able to detect whether employees are surfing popular shopping and gaming websites, the author does not specify whether the software can detect when employees are using the Internet to collaborate on company projects with each other or research solutions from third-party websites. Falsely attributing Internet use to wasting time and accusing employees of abusing Internet privileges could lead to low employee morale, which could lead to reduced productivity and profits. By not addressing these assumptions, the author's belief that employee's productivity could be increased by controlling Internet usage at company workstations is weakened.","human_feedback_text":"The explanation gives too many reasons but does not really develope a believable reasoning line.

For instance, you could select one or two assumptions that you find most critical and discuss them with more detailed examples and explanations. This approach will allow you to develop a more structured and compelling argument.\n\nTo improve the organization of your essay, it's beneficial to structure your response into multiple paragraphs. By dedicating a paragraph to each major point you wish to make, your essay will be easier to follow and understand. This structure will also give you the opportunity to elaborate on each point more thoroughly. A possible structure might include an introductory paragraph, one or two paragraphs that each focus on a different assumption, and a concluding paragraph that summarizes your stance.\n\nIt's also important to address possible counterarguments. Acknowledging and refuting potential weaknesses in your own argument can strengthen your position. By considering other perspectives, you not only demonstrate a balanced understanding of the issue but also reinforce the validity of your critique.\n\nRegarding the writing itself, your essay is generally clear and comprehensible, which is good.

It's important to closely adhere to the question asked, focusing specifically on whether you agree or disagree with the use of violent treatment in child education, rather than exploring the broader concept of power.\n\n2. **Clarity on Terms Used:**\nThe word \"power\" as used in your essay is too broad and doesn't accurately reflect the more specific action of \"spanking\" that seems to be at the heart of the debate. Understanding and applying the correct terminology is crucial for your argument to be relevant to the topic. The distinction between general power or authority and the act of spanking (implying physical punishment) needs to be clearer, as these terms carry very different connotations and implications for your argument.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**\nThere are a few spelling and grammatical issues throughout the essay that could confuse readers or detract from your main points. Additionally, some sentences feel incomplete or abruptly end, particularly where it seems like further explanation or examples could strengthen your argument. Paying attention to sentence structure and ensuring each thought is fully developed will significantly improve the readability and persuasiveness of your essay.\n\n4. **Clarity of Point of View:**\nYour point of view against the use of physical punishment in education comes across, but it could be expressed more clearly and compellingly with additional evidence, examples, or clarification of why you hold this view. For instance, mentioning scientific evidence about the negative effects of violence on children's mental health is a strong point, but including more details or sources could make your argument more convincing.\n\n5. **Descriptive Arguments:**\nWhile you make several claims about the negative impact of using violence in educational settings, the arguments would benefit greatly from more depth and specificity. Exploring the long-term effects of such treatment on children's development and behavior, for example, could provide a more comprehensive viewpoint. Likewise, contrasting violent discipline with more positive educational approaches could further solidify your stance.\n\nImproving these areas will not only enhance the quality of your essay but also ensure that it more accurately responds to the prompt and provides a coherent, well-supported argument. Remember, focusing on providing clear, concise, and specific explanations for your views will greatly contribute to the effectiveness of your writing."}

On the one hand, I think that traditional way of learning which have an interaction between students and teachers are really effective. By this way of learing, students can ask teacher something that they can solve by themselve. The more older teacher the more experiences that student can learn from them. When someone have a good tutor in their way of learning, they can use the knowlegde that they learn from their teacher confidently because the teacher have a lot of experience can make sure that their knowledge are true.

The prompt restatement + personal opinion is tremendously confusing. Where is the restatement for each public opinion? These should be provided in 2 individual sentences. Why is your opinion leased on an extent response when you are not writing an extent essay? It is also more difficult to understand your discussion as you have not used the paragraph writing format to divide your discussion topics. The discussion requires 3 reasoning paragraphs or, 2 reasoning paragraphs that provide your opinion for each public discussion. From what I have read, none of the writing format requirements were met by your presentation.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay touches on an important discussion about the role of teachers in education and compares traditional learning methods with self-guided learning through the internet and television. Here's how it can be improved to better meet English proficiency test standards:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to address the topic by discussing the importance of teachers and the value of self-learning. However, the introduction of personal viewpoints alongside public opinions without clear separation makes it hard to understand the essay's stance immediately. To improve, try starting with a clear thesis statement that outlines the main argument. Then, organize the essay into paragraphs that separately address public opinions and your own perspective.\n\n2. **Structural and Organizational Issues**: The essay lacks clear paragraph formatting, making it difficult to distinguish between different arguments. For English proficiency tests, use one paragraph for the introduction, 2-3 paragraphs for the body (each discussing a unique point), and one paragraph for the conclusion. In the body, dedicate separate paragraphs to discuss the effectiveness of traditional learning with teachers and learning through the internet or television. This structure will make your argument more coherent.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several spelling and grammatical mistakes throughout the essay, such as \"today society\" instead of \"today's society,\" and \"teacher are\" instead of \"teachers are.\" Also, watch out for run-on sentences and try to use more varied sentence structures to make your essay more engaging. For instance, consider revising sentences that are overly long for clarity and impact.\n\n4. **Clarity and Argumentation**: Your argument is partly unclear because of the mixture of opinions without explicit reasoning. To strengthen your essay, provide clear evidence and examples for each viewpoint. For traditional learning, mention specific benefits, like personalized feedback, which students cannot get from the internet. For internet learning, you could discuss the access to a wide range of resources. Clarifying your rationale will make your position stronger.\n\n5. **Point of View**: Your viewpoint seems divided and could be stated more clearly. If you believe both methods have their merits, clearly state this in your introduction and conclusion. In the body, dedicate time to explain why each method is effective, providing evidence and examples to support your claims.\n\n6. **Descriptive Arguments**: Enhance your arguments by offering more detailed descriptions and examples. Instead of vaguely stating that older teachers offer more experience, describe a specific scenario where teacher experience significantly aids student learning. Similarly, detail how internet learning can be more effective in certain situations.\n\nBy focusing on these points of feedback, the author of the essay will be able to significantly improve their writing, making their arguments clearer and more compelling while addressing the fundamental requirements of English proficiency test essays."}

IS IT ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO WORK HARD?","essay_text":"Why do some people work hard? Is it always a good thing to work hard? \\n These days, it is undeniable that some people are extremely studious and workaholic while others prefer not to exceed a certain limit. There are myriads of reasons for those attitudes to work and in my opinion, having a passion for work is estimable, whereas a hectic schedule of work would lead to some demerits. \\n There are three main causes encouraging people to work hard. Some people work extra shifts to receive a higher salary. They believe that they could earn a better living with more money and buy comforts for themselves and their families. Moreover, being hard-working could increase their chance of getting promotions and recognition, which is very beneficial to their career paths. Additionally, there are people passionate about their careers and work. They could work without paying any attention to the passing time to earn higher social status. \\n However, working hard could bring some adverse results. To begin with, people doing extra shifts, especially night shifts, could be under work pressure, so they are more likely to commit mistakes. As a result, they would make a huge loss to their company and be dismissed from their jobs. In addition, people would not have enough time for their families and friends if they spend all their days at work. Consequently, arguments could arise between partners in their relationships. Moreover, they do not give time to take care of themselves due to hectic working schedules, so physical and mental health problems such as stress would ensue. \\n In conclusion, working hard allows people to achieve their career goals and earn a better living. Nevertheless, it would be a risk worth taking if people work without caring about their health and their families.","human_feedback_text":"Providing direct topic responses to the provided questions will result in a higher TA score.

The writer may want to consider less reasons in favor of 2 reasons only next time.That is to allow better connected explanations and examples to help meet the C + C considerations. While the reasons are good and connected, a clearer explanation and example combining the reasons would have been the best presentation format.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay addresses the questions asked by discussing why some people work hard and whether it is always beneficial. This is a strong point because directly answering the questions helps make your stance clear, which is crucial for your essay's effectiveness. To further improve clarity and directly present your viewpoint, consider starting your essay with a clear statement that directly responds to the questions. This approach can make your opinion even more obvious to readers from the beginning.\n\nThe reasons given for why people work hard are relevant and help explain different motivations. However, focusing on fewer reasons could enhance your essay. By choosing perhaps two main reasons and exploring these in greater depth, you can provide clearer explanations and more detailed examples. This strategy would not only make your arguments stronger but also help your essay meet higher standards for coherence and cohesion, as linking your ideas and examples closely together is key to a well-structured argument.\n\nA positive aspect of your essay is how it introduces both sides of the argument, showing the benefits and drawbacks of working hard. This balanced approach demonstrates critical thinking. Nevertheless, in discussing the negatives of working hard, ensuring that the consequences you describe are directly linked to the initial reasons can strengthen your argument. For instance, if excessive work for higher pay leads to health issues, drawing a clear line between these points makes your argument more compelling.\n\nOn the style and readability, your essay is generally well-written, but you should be cautious of minor spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. For example, consider simpler language and more varied sentence structures to improve readability and keep your audience engaged. Additionally, watch out for repetitive phrases and aim for more concise expressions to sharpen your writing.\n\nFinally, your conclusion does a good job summarizing your views but could be enhanced by directly referring back to the initial questions for a strong ending. Wrapping up your essay by reaffirming your stance on whether working hard is always a good thing can provide a satisfying conclusion for your readers.\n\nOverall, your essay has strong potential. With focused improvements on clarity of opinion, depth over breadth in your arguments, avoiding minor grammatical errors, and tightening your conclusion, your writing will be more impactful."}

The answer to this question will assuredly vary from people to people. Some may support this statement believing that it can enrich our experiences, while others can oppose, arguing that we should focus on what we like and do best. Based on my own experiences as a youngster, I prefer the former opinion and agree that sometimes, we should do things we dislike. Below, I will give my arguments and examples to substantiate this point of view. \\n In life, we usually like to indulge ourselves with pleasures even when they may not bring benefits to us, such as buying expensive phones despite a limited budget or skipping classes to hang out with friends. On the other hand, things that are not very enjoyable to execute can actually be beneficial. My personal experience with exercising can serve as an example. As a busy person juggling with work, study and social activities simultaneously, I usually ate out and rarely went to the gym. I was hesitant to exercise because it required much energy and effort. Moreover, I was already exhausted by other tasks. As a result, after four years living with this hectic lifestyle, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure disease, which forced me to alter my living condition and join more outing activities. Currently, with a proper eating diet and regular exercising schedule, I succeed in keeping my blood pressure in the average range. From this example, it can be seen that the things we do not enjoy doing can sometimes be of great help to us. \\n What's more, trying new things not only broadens your horizon but also helps you discover your capabilities, especially when you are a teenager. As youngsters usually have an immature viewpoint of life, they may not make the wisest decisions. Thus, experiencing different things can teach them valuable lessons and guide them in the right direction. For instance, after finishing high school, I still could not make up my mind about my career path. Therefore, I decided to take a gap year and try various jobs and internships in order to discover my passion. Surprisingly, despite my unfavorable opinions of accountant and auditor, I realized that I truly enjoyed my accounting internship and excelled in all the tasks I was given. At the same time, the incident also taught me to be more open-minded and to never judge a book by its cover. As you can clearly see, doing things that seem not very exciting or enjoyable can open up many unexpected opportunities and bring us cherished lessons. \\n Based on the above illustrations, I believe that people should sometimes do things they do not enjoy doing as it can be beneficial and broaden their horizon.","human_feedback_text":"Trang, you cannot write more than 5 sentences per paragraph for this test.

It is, however, unfair to generalize, only, cities reflects the mirage of society. Moreover, other parts of the country also needed to be studied to get the complete information of, traits of society, as a whole. \\n In today's fast paced and competitive world, cities play an important role to the countries social, economic and political facets of the country. Apparently, cities are the political and financial hub of the country. International relations and foreign policies are established here. Also, most of the major governmental bodies enact, discusses major decisions, and implement it smoothly for welfare of the country in cities. Likewise, financial budget-for the proper operation and development works of the country-is appropriated in capitals. But regardless of these facts, rapid urbanization and industrialization, in major cities, in competition for being best, cities have lost true essence of the society. \\n Surely, one of the indispensable characteristics of society is culture and language, which reflects identity, beliefs, traditions, and behaviour encompassed by the people dwelling on society. Even when, major cities represent a part of cultural diversity and variations of language that represents society, studying of these aspects in cities only, one will not obtain outright information. For instance, Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is one of the major cities.

I believe we live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities. For example, smartphones are our necessities today. However, we lived without smartphones ten years ago. Two main reasons make smartphones so popular. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss the details and give specific examples. \\n First, smartphones have various entertainments, such as video games, movie apps, photo editors, etc. These entertainments make our lives joyful. We can use smartphones to play video games online with people all over the work. This feeling is amazing, especially after our stressful work. For example, the football video game on smartphones is very realistic. Having a game with friends is the most popular activity for football fans. \\n Second, smartphones contain many tools, such as the calculator, clock, notebook, etc. We no longer carry a heavy bag with all the tools. We can also read our textbooks on our smartphones. So, the smartphone saves our environment. For example, to produce paper books, millions of trees are cut down every year. To produce the plastic equipment, the air and water are polluted. Smartphones reduce the pollution caused by production. \\n Smartphones have replaced traditional equipment and have become our necessities today.

For instance, the phrase \"all over the work\" should likely be \"all over the world.\" To improve readability and professionalism, aim for variety in sentence structure and more formal language. Avoid using \"etc.\" in formal essays; instead, briefly list examples or simply conclude the sentence without it.\n\n**3.

For example, when discussing entertainment, you could delve into how smartphones allow for not only leisure but also social connections across distances, highlighting a deeper necessity than mere amusement.\n\nFor improved structure, aim for five paragraphs: an introduction that includes a strong thesis, three paragraphs for arguments (each dedicated to a specific reason or example), and a conclusion that synthesizes your argument and reflects back on the statement.\n\nYour tone and level of analysis should reflect a more mature and reasoned argument. Consider the implications of smartphone usage on society, the environment, and individual well-being, providing a nuanced view rather than a straightforward list. This depth of analysis will demonstrate critical thinking and elevate your essay towards the standard expected of an educator.\n\nIn conclusion, focus on developing a clearer, stronger thesis statement, deepening your argument with more detailed examples and analysis, and refining your grammar and style.

A person spending most of his life in England, for instance, speaks this universal language more naturally and fluently than the one living in Asian countries. That is why some language centres having native speakers can attract more students than others. \\n Secondly, communicating with the locals frequently helps the learners think and speak in English instead of translating for their mother language. Gradually, English becomes their second language but a compulsory one. \\n Despite the strengths that studying in an English-speaking country have on the table, this way of learning seems to be more suitable for the youngster whose adaptability is better. Adults or the elder who have spoken their language for a long time find it difficult to remember and digest all the vocabulary and definitions in English, so they need some guidance in their mother tongues. Moreover, with the development of cutting-edge technology, people now can easily get access to websites allowing users to connect with native speakers.

It's important to closely align the introduction and subsequent arguments directly with the statement that diverse methods exist for learning English well beyond being in an English-speaking country.\n\n2.

Additionally, pay attention to more accurate word choices and sentence structure to enhance readability and ensure the text flows smoothly. Utilizing varied sentence structures and transitions can also help in improving the stylistic quality of the essay.\n\n3. Clarity of Author's Point of View:\nThe author's point of view is present but gets somewhat diluted by the mixed messages about the effectiveness of learning English in English-speaking countries versus other methods. Strengthening the essay requires a clearer stance throughout, focusing exclusively on supporting the position that there are effective alternative methods to learn English outside English-speaking environments.\n\n4. Descriptive Arguments Supporting the Position:\nThe argument that technology facilitates learning English is valid but underdeveloped. Expanding on how technology and other resources contribute to learning English efficiently can offer more robust support to the essay's thesis. Rather than mentioning alternative methods in brief, delve deeper into how these methods are effective, provide examples, and compare them to traditional learning environments to solidify your argument. This approach would not only demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic but also firmly bolster the essay's initial claim.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on a consistent and clearly articulated argument throughout the essay, along with refining spelling, grammar, and stylistic elements, will significantly enhance the quality and impact of the writing. Concentrate on expanding and detailing the alternative methods of learning English, providing specific examples, and elucidating how these can be as beneficial, if not more so, than learning in an English-speaking country.

All practice tests as designed to discover the problem areas of your English skills. If you cheat the system by looking up the words and grammar in an effort to try and improve your practice score, you will not be fooling anyone but yourself. Come time for the actual test, you will most likely freeze and be unable to write because you already got used to perfecting your essays through online help. \\n Remember this, you do not need to present a grammatically perfect essay.

Your stance on the issue is clear, suggesting that media violence is among the causes, but emphasizing good parenting and a stronger juvenile legal system as more effective solutions.

For example, \"which they are not being able to spend\" could be simplified to \"as they are unable to spend.\" Work on simplifying sentences to directly convey your ideas and ensure subject-verb agreement throughout.\n\n2. **Clarity and Descriptiveness**: While you provide reasons for the increase in youth crime, offering more specific examples or evidence would strengthen your arguments. Instead of general statements about the influence of media or the necessity of good parenting, detail how these factors directly affect youth behavior and crime rates. This specificity will make your argument more persuasive.\n\n3. **Stylistic Issues**: The essay could benefit from varied sentence structures to maintain reader interest and emphasize key points. Also, be cautious with word choice to ensure accuracy. For example, \"adolescence\" refers to a period of life, not to individuals; \"adolescents\" would be the correct term.\n\n4. **Consistency in Vocabulary**: While it's good to demonstrate a broad vocabulary, ensure that the words used accurately reflect your intended meaning and are used consistently throughout the essay.

Some people begin to think that it is good to preserve old buildings whenever possible. Other people think that it is preferable to construct new buildings. Both ideas all have their advantages and disadvantages. \\n In the first opinion, old buildings can be used for tourism, especially sightseeing. By exploring old structures we know more about our past, and it's also a good way to remind us about our culture. To illustrate, most of the results in many researches by historians, were found by investigating aged houses. At those places they figured out many vestiges about ancient generations. Thus, unmodern houses may not contain many stayable values but they have a lot of historical values. But besides that, they might waste too many places and money, which can be used to build modern buildings, the ones that really have physical values. \\n On the other hand, the advantages of constructing new buildings is undeniable, they bring us a convenient, modern place. Present-day structures compare with earlier versions are more secure, steady and harder to decay. For instance, in the past the durability of old houses helped them be undestroyable by natural factors for 5 years, now a modern house can stand for 10 years. Contrasting with old buildings, new buildings have more physical use but less spiritual benefits. In the past, when globalization hadn't happened yet, every country had their own type of architecture, dissimilar features. But the world is different now, people always want the best version, so buildings are more and more similar. If we just focus on building new things, our traditional values will sink into oblivion over time. \\n In conclusion, preserving old buildings have many immaterial meanings but nearly have no practical use and the benefits and drawbacks in constructing new buildings is converse. From my standpoint, whatever it is, conserving old things or building new things, the most important thing is we have to balance it, so that we not only can develop our architecture, but also maintain our traditional culture.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>From my standpoint, whatever ... our traditional culture.<\/quotation> \\n This is the response to the question provided for the discussion. It should be in the restatement + personal opinion paragraph first, then repeated in the summary conclusion. This is a clearer personal opinion statement when compared to the restatement and opinion entry. This creates a more academically formatted thesis statement. \\n Vocabulary building is a must for this student. He must avoid making up English words. Terms such as \" unmodern\" do not exist in any English dictionary version. It will lower the vocabulary score for the exam taker. \\n in the second paragraph, the explanation suddenly changes from the value of old buildings to a reason why it should be torn down. This is an unexpected turn that reduced the clarity of that sentence. Unrelated points must be transitioned into and discussed in a seperate paragraph to preserve coherence in the discussion. \\n The essay is actually proof of academic discussion skills on the part of the exam taker. Further improvement is required in specific sections to further boost his score in specific areas.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay on the balance between preserving old buildings and constructing new ones explores a relevant and interesting topic. It successfully addresses the question by presenting both sides of the argument before stating a personal standpoint in the conclusion. This approach demonstrates an understanding of the essay's requirements. However, there are several areas where improvements would make the essay stronger and more effective.\n\nFirstly, it's important to ensure that the essay's introduction includes a clearer thesis statement. This statement should summarize the essay's main points and include the author's personal opinion on the matter. By doing so, readers will have a clear understanding of the essay's direction from the beginning. While the conclusion revisits the author's stance, introducing this perspective more explicitly at the start would strengthen the overall structure and clarity.\n\nVocabulary use is crucial for effectively conveying your message. Avoid creating or using non-standard English words, such as \"unmodern\". This detracts from the essay's credibility and can affect the assessment of language proficiency. Expanding and refining your vocabulary will enhance your expressions and contribute to a higher evaluation. \n\nWhen discussing the advantages and disadvantages of preserving old buildings versus constructing new ones, make sure each point is clearly related and transitions smoothly into the next. The sudden shift in the second paragraph from the value of old buildings to reasons they may be considered less favorable was abrupt. Maintaining coherence in your argument is key; if introducing a contrasting point, it may be more effective to address it in a separate paragraph. This will keep the discussion organized and easy to follow.\n\nAdditionally, remember to avoid making unrelated points without proper transition. This will help in maintaining the essay's coherence and ensure that each paragraph contributes effectively to your overall argument.\n\nIn conclusion, the essay demonstrates promising academic discussion skills, with room for improvement in specific areas. Focusing on developing a strong, clear thesis statement from the outset, expanding and refining vocabulary, and ensuring coherence and clarity in the argument's structure will significantly enhance the essay's effectiveness and the author's score."}

The government's concern to make sure that students are qualified to enter college is one of the reasons why this will be a never-ending discussion. Nevertheless, having students study the same curriculum until entering college has more negatives than positives. \\n First, the hope that studying the same curriculum will perfectly prepare students for college may be wrong. Of course minimum standards on general subjects will be good, but colleges may differ on their concentration of studies. For example some colleges focus on technology whereas another has manufacturing as its focus. The variety of concentrations means that different understandings are required by future students, depending on their college preference. By having an established same curriculum througout the country, students will not have variety of subjects to deepen their understanding for planned future studies. A student who is interested in medicine may not need advanced mathematics. While engineering students may need a strong background in mathematics, but not really need understand advanced linguistics. \\n Another point that should be considerd is every students have different characteristics, thus different potentials. A boy may have strong interest in sports and applied mathematics, while his friend has more interest in biology and theoritcal mathematics. Implementing same national curriculum will make the first boy develop well. On the other hand, his friend will be leaved with unfilled potential as his interests are not included in the curriculum. Therefore, a diversed curriculum will be better to fulfill the potential of both children. \\n Schools nowadays may have different standards as there are the so-called favorite schools. A favorite school in Los Angeles can attract smart students where the majority will have a strong financial background. This condition will support the availability of more quality educators. On the other hand, a school in Hawaii may only have local students and the teachers employed though good do not stand on the same level with the Los Angeles teachers. Favoritism of schools will have an impact on teachers available, as higher-standard schools will employ more qualified educators. In these circumstances, having a same national curriculum may prove to have more disadvantages as not all teachers will be willing to accept national standards. \\n For certain subjects curriculum standards are necessary, but implementing same national curriculum throughout may be unwise. As explained above same national curriculum has more disadvantages. Unless the government develops solutions for the problems stated above, same national curriculum should not be implemented.","human_feedback_text":"Your potential score for this essay is a 3. The low score is based on the grammar, logic, and sentence formation problems that exist in the presentation. Your discussion is inconsistent and does not follow a logical flow of thought. When you speak of a student inclined to study medicine, and a student interested in engineering, both students require advanced math education. Therefore, your argument becomes flawed and incorrect. \\n The favoritism of schools has no relation to the standard curriculum discussion. Your opinion does not show how the school favoritism system is connected to the discussion of a uniform curriculum. This discussion is unrelated to the topic, making it an irrelevant detail in the presentation. \\n You failed to clearly explain the reasons why you do not support a uniform curriculum. Your logic is flawed. You did not understand the actual requirements of the topic for discussion before you wrote the essay. It would be better if you read some sample GRE essays before you try to write another opinion paper. Familiarize yourself with possible discussion topics and how the previous students approached the discussion first. Then try to write your own take on the topic. That should help improve your logic and discussion flaws.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay discusses the debate around standardizing the curriculum for students up until college, arguing that this might not be the best approach due to the diverse needs and interests of students. However, there are several areas where improvements can significantly enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of the essay.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:**\nYour essay is relevant to the prompt, as it addresses the implications of a standardized curriculum. However, the points made need to be more directly tied back to the question of whether standardization is beneficial or not, ensuring every argument clearly supports your stance against it.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**\nThe essay contains spelling errors (e.g., \"oftenly\" should be \"often,\" \"througout\" should be \"throughout,\" \"considerd\" should be \"considered\"). There are also grammar issues that disrupt the flow and clarity (e.g., \"every students have different characteristics\" should be \"every student has different characteristics\"). To improve fluency and understandability, sentences should be simpler and more direct. Avoid unnecessary complexity to make your arguments more accessible.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View:**\nYour viewpoint is present but gets lost amidst the essay's inconsistencies and logical discrepancies. To make your stance standout, begin with a clear thesis statement in your introduction, summarizing your position. Each paragraph should then open with a topic sentence that introduces the argument being made, followed by evidence and examples that clearly tie back to your thesis.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:**\nThe arguments presented are sometimes contradictory or underdeveloped. For instance, the claim about students' varying needs for advanced mathematics is contradicted by the acknowledged need for advanced math in both medicine and engineering fields. To strengthen your essay, ensure your arguments are consistent and supported by accurate examples or evidence. Eliminating unrelated discussions, such as the favoritism of schools, which does not directly support your stance on the curriculum debate, will also improve clarity and relevance.\n\nAdditionally, it is crucial to directly address why a uniform curriculum might be seen as beneficial and then clearly refute these points with your arguments. This approach will demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic and add depth to your critique.\n\nIn summary, focusing on clear, consistent arguments supported by accurate examples and addressing the topic directly will enhance the essay's effectiveness. Paying attention to grammar and style will also improve readability, making your arguments more compelling to your audience. Taking time to plan your essay, ensuring each paragraph has a clear purpose and directly ties back to your main argument, will help achieve a more logical and cohesive structure."}

The essay will expatiate on both opinions and present my view. \\n On the one hand, that selecting students on the basis of their academic levels can substantially benefit students and teachers is strongly affirmed. Regarding the beneficial impacts on students, they are undoubtedly offered an ideal environment for their self-development, mental health improvement and specialization enhancement. \\n To be more specific, while those with excellent academic abilities can be motivated and inspired to constantly make progress in their study when surrounded with other brilliant scholars, students with poor academic performance do not have to cope with the peer pressure from so-called academic geniuses and correspondingly dedicate their spare time to developing their social skills, personal strengths and talents. In the meantime, teachers can also relish advantages of separate education by reducing the burden of taking care of students with great disparity in academic levels or assisting average students in catching up with their outstanding peers. \\n On the other hand, it is also beneficial to students when being blended together in the same class regardless of their scholastic achievements and potentials. Firstly, they can have the opportunity to become more well-rounded through exchanging their knowledge and understanding with one another. By means of illustration, those who are well-versed in a particular subject can impart knowledge to their classmates and aid teachers in tutoring them, hence, members of this typical inclusive class are able to expand their knowledge of all fields and subjects. Secondly, young learners in the same class can enjoy the prospects of exploring their interests in other areas, acquiring a diversity of skills and learning about various opinions and thoughts. \\n In conclusion, although each format has its own distinctive merits, I assume that schools should be composed of students with a wide range of abilities as this environment could offer students a chance to explore their passion and interests, and become more well-rounded.","human_feedback_text":"Though the essay showcases your ability to use advanced English words in your explanation, it is not the kind of essay that would get a passing mark.

While the essay attempts to cover both perspectives of the debate, the introduction of a personal viewpoint is vague. A clearer thesis statement at the beginning could significantly strengthen the essay by outlining the writer's stance and how it will be explored throughout the piece. Remember, stating your opinion clearly at the start helps guide the reader through your argumentation.\n\nIn terms of language use, while the proficient employment of advanced vocabulary is impressive, it's equally important to focus on clarity and coherence. Sometimes, simpler language can convey ideas more effectively, particularly for an audience of English language learners. Strive for a balance between sophisticated language use and straightforward expression to ensure your ideas are accessible and engaging for all readers.\n\nRegarding content structure, the essay would benefit from a more explicit organization. Each paragraph should contain a clear main idea, supported by specific examples or arguments. While both sides of the argument are presented, developing each point with more detailed examples and clearly linking them back to your main thesis will make your stance more persuasive. \n\nMoreover, the conclusion attempts to provide a resolution but falls short of convincingly advocating for the writer's own perspective. A stronger conclusion would not only summarize the arguments presented but also emphatically state your position, reinforcing why it is preferable in light of the discussion.\n\nFinally, careful proofreading to catch and correct any spelling, grammar, or stylistic issues would also polish the essay further. Although these mistakes were not glaringly obvious, refining your essay to eliminate such errors can dramatically improve its overall professionalism and readability.\n\nTo enhance your essay, focus on:\n- Providing a clear thesis statement that reflects your viewpoint.\n- Using language that balances sophistication with clarity.\n- Structuring the essay with distinct, well-developed points that support your thesis.\n- Concluding with a strong, persuasive restatement of your perspective.\n- Thoroughly proofreading to correct any mistakes.\n\nImprovements in these areas can transform your essay into a more compelling and clear response to the topic, better reflecting your understanding and command of the English language."}

Personally, I agree with this opinion because of the beneficial effects of e-papers for us. \\n There is a large quantity of reasons that account for the magnitude of e-papers, but the most basic one is that without paying, e-papers permit people to swiftly update the newest news hourly everywhere. People who are too busy to keep their posted about regular occurrences, e-paper could help with just a click on your bottom. It would send you brief notifications of news on your mobile phone; hence, you will not fritter your time away on going outside and buying newspapers.

The original topic asked for a discussion on whether printed newspapers or books would become obsolete and the possibility of accessing news online without payment. The essay, however, shifts to a general preference for electronic newspapers due to convenience, missing the specific point about cost implication.

Mentioning specific reasons for your enthusiasm can make your argument stronger and show your genuine interest in the profession. For instance, is it the joy of sharing knowledge, the chance to shape young minds, or something else that draws you to teaching?\n\n3. While you've listed some essential skills for becoming a teacher (like patience, diligence, and having a good education), further elaboration on how you plan to develop these skills or examples of how you are already working on them would strengthen your essay. \n\n4. Pay attention to a few stylistic issues. The sentence \"I have got the enthusiasm to be a teacher from my father, who is a teacher too\" could be simplified for clarity, such as \"My father, a teacher, inspired my enthusiasm for teaching.\" Additionally, be mindful of using varied sentence structures to keep your essay interesting for the reader.\n\n5. The conclusion of your essay reiterates your ambition but doesn't add new information or insight. Consider closing with a reflection on how your current efforts will help you achieve your dream or what being a professional teacher means to you personally.\n\nRemember, the purpose of an essay is not only to inform but also to engage and persuade the reader about your viewpoint. Showing your personal connection to the subject and demonstrating a deeper understanding of what the profession entails can make your essay both more convincing and compelling."}

I disagree with this view and believe that the role of these sporting occasions is overrated. \\n Firstly, a single sport tournament could not help alleviate international prolonged disputes. The event, which is held periodically, can sure captivate civilians' attention and enable them to forget the grief they are suffering to join in a celebration of sorts, for a few seconds. However, the majority of the time they have to spend on dealing with serious wars' consequences . Solider and civilian causalities, violation of human rights, infrastructure destruction, crime, illiteracy among other mental health issues from the trauma of the wars would definitely take up a significant amount of time to recover and rebuild. From ancient to recent time, it is ambiguous that sports can bring people together and pave a path to peace. The Romans and Greeks would interrupt battle to participate in the games, but for a fixed time only. While the U.S. national team played Cuba for the first time was due more to FIFA requirements than any diplomatic efforts on the part of either country. \\n Interestingly, there is a firm correlation between strong feelings of patriotism and the likelihood of war. In fact, people who are patriotic have a greater sense of belonging to a particular nation or what is so-called \"national identity.\" The concept of placing their own country over another in terms of religious differences, political policies or economic envy can encourage violence against the neighboring countries. El Salvado beat Honduras in a World Cup qualifying match which later ignited longstanding elevating tension between the two countries into a brief war is a vivid example of a legacy of pain and pride between the two. The promising outlook that Irag can host its first national soccer team home game takes nothing for granted to the principles of sports which promote cultural plurality and togetherness. In contrast, a deep-rooted destructive relationship after the U.S. evasion of Irag would trigger a revenge massacre for the killing of approximately 500,000 Iraqis. \\n In conclusion, sports' power to heal is stronger than hatred power to destroy has been mirages. The termination of war demands more than sole sporting diplomacy.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, it is my opinion that you have written an essay worth a score of 6 at the most. While your conviction and tone is very strongly represented in your work, there are still a number of problems that have prevented you from gaining a higher score. One of the problems is the presentation of your opening statement. You presented a 2 sentence overview when the requirement is for a minimum of 3 sentences. You could have presented the reasons separately in order to meet that requirement or, you could have expanded upon the prompt restatement in order to create a more engaging opening piece. The conclusion also suffers from a similar problem. There is also an issue with your lexical resource. Evasion means to avoid something while invasion, means an unwelcome intrusion into another domain. Bear in mind that you will lose points for misused words. So if you are not sure of the meaning, do not use it in the essay. The wrong word usage affects more than your lexical score, it also has a direct effect on your GRA. So your otherwise strong essay was weakened by the problematic language representation.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay presents a clear stance on the debate regarding the role of sports events in reconciling international conflicts and fostering national pride, engaging with a complex topic with confidence. However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the overall effectiveness and coherence of your argument.\n\nFirstly, it's imperative to ensure your essay fully responds to the topic by providing a more developed introduction. The opening statement sets the stage for your argument but needs a minimum of three sentences to adequately preview the points you will discuss. Consider expanding your introduction by clearly outlining your main arguments or by offering a more detailed background to the issue at hand. This will not only meet the structural requirement but also create a more engaging and informative start to your essay.\n\nOn the matter of spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, careful attention to word choice is crucial. For example, the word \"evasion\" was used in place of \"invasion,\" which alters the intended meaning and could confuse readers. Misused words can detract from your essay's credibility and impact your score. Always ensure that the vocabulary you choose accurately conveys your message. If uncertain about a word's meaning, it's better to opt for a different term you are more comfortable with.\n\nYour point of view is convincingly clear throughout the essay; however, making your arguments more descriptive and providing concrete examples could strengthen your position. While you mention historical and contemporary examples, delving deeper into these events or providing additional instances could offer a more persuasive argument and clarify your viewpoint further.\n\nLastly, the conclusion of your essay, much like the introduction, could benefit from expansion. Rather than merely summarizing your stance, consider reiterating the significance of your argument in a broader context or suggesting potential implications for the future. A stronger conclusion will leave a lasting impression on the reader and reinforce the key points made in your essay.\n\nIn summary, by expanding both the introduction and conclusion, being mindful of word choice, and offering more detailed examples to support your arguments, your essay can become more compelling and articulate. Your engagement with the topic is clear and presents a solid foundation upon which to build a stronger argument."}

There is a view that by the end of year 2050, the typical presence of teacher and students in classroom will cease to exist. However, In my opinion, I agree with mentioned statement to certain extent as their will still be certain scenarios that shall remain as it is. \\n Firstly, the pace with which education infrastructure is growing and adapting, it can be established that societies are accepting the virtual education platform. For instance, over the duration of past decade, fifty percent of the total academic degree's are now being offered online and by the end of next decade, it will be one-hundred percent. Recent technological advancements, such as virtual laboratories, assessments through artifical intelligence, certification exams being proctored using web-cam has left presence of individuals in classroom redundant. Evidently, with all the news ways of teaching, the typical presence of the students and a teacher in school classes is questionable. \\n However, I believe certain scenarious between teachers and students are most-likely to remain unchanged for possibly the next three-decades. As an example, childrens will still be asked for regular home-work, assignment submission and regular examination. Failing to which, they could face same consequences. Furthermore, the most obvious problem of childrens being unattentive in classes and facing punishment would stay unchanged, even if the lectures are delivered virtually. Although there might be changes in the way childrens are punished so as to motivate them to study, but that shall not hinder the regular arguments between them. \\n To recapitulate, with the advancement of technology and changing behaviour of education delivery by 2050, In my opinion, certain, traditional scenarios between teachers and pupil, such as arguments, and punishments shall stay unchanged.","human_feedback_text":"Nope. You cannot have a middle of the road response. You cannot be partly anything in this essay because you deliver conflicting opinions, which means you do not have an opinion at all.

That is because your second statement is the only valid statement, in relation to the given discussion. Perhaps you were unaware that your first discussion paragraph was not relevant to the teaching dynamic being discussed in the essay. \\n It is not about the classroom setting, it is about the teacher-student relationship.

While the intention behind the topic is commendable, there are several key areas for improvement to make your essay more coherent and effective.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay attempts to straddle both sides of the argument concerning the future of teacher-student interactions and the role of technology in education. However, to strengthen your essay, it's important to adopt a clear stance. Your argument seems to lean more towards the belief that, despite technological advancements, certain traditional aspects of the teacher-student relationship will persist. Focusing on this perspective right from the beginning would provide a solid foundation for your arguments.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors present, such as \"their\" instead of \"there\" and \"childrens\" instead of \"children.\" Paying close attention to these details will enhance the readability of your essay. Additionally, considering the simplification of complex sentences could aid in achieving clearer communication.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your viewpoint appears split, which makes it somewhat challenging to discern your primary thesis. A stronger assertion of your opinion will help clarify the angle of your argument to the reader. Remember, a decisive stance strengthens your essay's persuasive power.\n\n4. **Arguments Supporting the Position**: While you provide examples to support your forecast of how education might evolve, ensuring these examples directly tie back to the core thesis of maintaining some traditional educational practices amidst technological advancements will add depth to your argument. Your focus on virtual learning advancements was a good start, but more emphasis on why and how certain traditional elements (like homework and the necessity of discipline) will remain would make your argument more compelling.\n\nTo improve, try the following steps:\n- Reevaluate your stance and choose a definitive position on the future of education with technology's role in it.\n- Outline your main arguments before you start writing to ensure they align with your thesis and discussion prompt.\n- Incorporate examples directly relevant to the teacher-student dynamic rather than general advancements in technology.\n- Revise for grammatical accuracy and clarity, simplifying complex thoughts where possible.\n\nStarting with a clearer understanding of the topic's deeper implications will not only help in presenting a more assertive stance but also enable you to structure your essay around more relevant and impactful arguments.

Indeed, many people have shown their advocacy of a society in which cash gives place to other means of payments. However, there is still certain opposition against this scenario given security concerns. From my personal perspective, cash-free transfer should be promoted and applied on a large scale. \\n In the first place, purchasing can be considerably simplified when cash is not required. In the time when online shopping is booming, together with an ever-increasing demand for commercial goods from customers, the need to find a quick, convenient and reliable way of transactions emerges to be prominent. In this case, digital payments such as credit cards and money transfering are definitely fitting alternatives to hard cash due to their versatility and accuracy. To illustrate, there is now no need in having to travel a long distance to original shops or supermarkets, as people can order everything they want within a mouse click, using money-transferring method. This example clearly attests the advantage of this technology-based means of transactions over the traditional cash-only one. \\n By the same token, a cashless society opens new opportunities for employment and business. In fact, globalization means that people are nowadays not confined within their home nations in their search for jobs, as they can work internationally. By utilizing digitized methods, wages or salaries will be transferred to the employees' accounts and can be used directly without the need of currency exchange at local banks. Home freelancers are a perfect illustration of this point, when they can accept multiple tasks simultaneously and derive abundant income from different sources. Vice versa, cashless transactions also enable local undertakings to expand their market and customers network. Indeed, such retailers as Amazon, Alibaba and IKEA have leveraged this means of transfer to attain a global outreach and become retail tycoons. \\n Many people cast their doubt on the reasonability of a without-cash world. They state unlawful acts, namely financial frauds and information leakage, as possible spectres to their personal security. However, given the general concerns towards this issue, the majority of banking companies have implemented strict measures regarding the clients' data privacy. Additionally, as users are fully informed of every transactional activities by the banks, they hold the control of their accounts and can report any abnormalities for the sake of safety. In other words, a bilateral relationship will be established between banks and customers, which ensures reliability and security. \\n In conclusion, I personally support the vista of a cashless world, considering the convenience and career prospects that it can afford. Although it is still a long way to go, I hold a firm belief that cash will be someday totally superseded by more state-of-the-art methods of transaction.","human_feedback_text":"The third reasoning paragraph is unnecessary since you are not being asked to discuss the possible drawbacks, repercussions, or opposite point of view in the essay.

In my opinion, it have more drawbacks that benefits. \\n One of the reason caused many young people are likely to switch jobs is this kind of young people want a better quality of life. New jobs offer them higher salaries. So young people can gain more money to get the higher living standard. Another reason is them have greater ambition. They are willing to challenging new things, such as they are able to study different skills in the work. Therefore, that can be satisfied. Young people always change jobs bring some negative effects. It takes time to adapt to the new environment and be promoted to a higher position. People need to know the surrounding of new jobs, so it spend their time to be conversant. Also, the first people to enter the company start from the bottom, so if young people always change jobs, they would have no opportunities to promote. For instance, when they have only been working at the bottom for a few mouths, that may have started to think about new jobs and they only gain the starting salaries. \\n What's more, young people who like to change jobs not be trusted with responsibility. It shows that this kind of people are not loyal with their companies. So big firms are likely to employ the common worker instead of disloyal worker. Some firms even think this kind of disloyal people will bring the secret of firms to public. \\n While there are some benefits to young people who like to switch jobs. They enable to learn more new skills, such as they may cook before, but now they work in the clothes companies, so they can learn spinning. \\n To sum up, I understand that change jobs again and again have some positive impacts, I believed that it bring more negative effects to the young people.","human_feedback_text":"The essay restatement is good. It clearly restates the prompt and outlines the discussion paragraphs clearly. However, when it came to the actual application of the discussion paragraphs, the essay presentation fell apart. It created confusing paragraph presentations because of the unreasonable focus on reasons rather than a comparative discussion. The format for the reasoning paragraphs should have been: \\n - Perceived advantage topic \\n - Reason why you see the advantage as a disadvantage \\n - Supporting example depicting the advantage as a true disadvantage \\n - Additional explanation (optional) in support of the example \\n - Introduction to the next topic \\n Just 5 sentences covering 2 related topics in one paragraph. This would have created a cohesive and coherent reasoning discussion which would have tremendously boosted your scores across all sections. You have actually written an essay that shows your familiarity with the topic. The problem, is that you were unable to properly support your explanations with clear reasoning presentations. Always remember, it is the clarity of the explanation, not the number of reasons that help you score well in the end.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay addresses the topic by discussing why many young people frequently change jobs and whether the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages. It's commendable that you clearly restated the prompt and outlined the main ideas you planned to discuss. This shows a good understanding of the task. \n\nHowever, your essay would benefit significantly from a clearer organization and more precise arguments. Rather than focusing solely on listing reasons, aim to critically analyze each point by discussing both sides. For instance, you could structure your paragraphs to begin with a perceived advantage of changing jobs, explain why it might actually be a disadvantage, provide a supporting example, and then, if necessary, offer additional explanation. This approach would help in making your argument stronger and more coherent.\n\nMoreover, there are a few areas where spelling, grammar, and stylistic improvements are needed. For example:\n- It\u2019s \"likely to change\" not \"likely yo change.\"\n- Use \"it has more drawbacks than benefits\" instead of \"it have more drawbacks that benefits.\"\n- Make sure to use \"these kinds of young people\" instead of \"this kind of young people.\"\n- Verbs should agree with their subjects, for example, \"it spends their time to be conversant\" should be corrected for clarity and correctness.\n\nYour point of view is clear in that you believe the disadvantages of frequently changing jobs outweigh the advantages. However, your essay would be stronger if you used specific examples to support this view more effectively.

Personally, I totally disagree with that statement and believe that humans should continue using animals for those objectives. \\n First and foremost, products that come from sources of animals are far more cost-effective. Specifically, farming is considered the most developed industry in various nations which means that the facilities serving for feeding and growing animals have already been top-notch. Therefore, the government does not need to put a budget in this field anymore and it could easily provide sufficient products to fulfill the demand of the citizens. For example, the USA consumes a lot of animals products and because of their farming system, the price of those are significantly affordable. \\n Secondly, the use of animal products has become a habit of the majority of people so it would be extremely challenging to change those. In other words, people would always choose animal products as it is used globally rather than the ones that have not been used much lately. For instance, in the medical field when someone's life is in danger, they would rather pick a safe option that consumes medicines that come from animals since they have been used largely than make a risky choice to use one that is strange to them. Thus, there is really no chance for those products to compete against animal products. \\n In conclusion, I strongly believe that food, medicines, and clothes from animal sources are far more reliable and should be used compared to other sources.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>I totally disagree with that statement<\/quotation> \\n There is no need for a measured response in this statement.

Is it positive or negative","essay_text":"In this modern era, there are a number of countries, which have a tendency to import the foreigner food all over the world. Recently,these activities lead to both advantageous and disadvantageous consequences. This essay would show my point of view about both sides of this issue \\n On the one hand,food importing countries are able to vary their domestic volume of food and also make profits for those exporting ones. Firstly, when nutrition demands are higher and higher day by day, the governments need to meet the requirements of all the citizens. Thus, not only international relations but also people's health qualities are improved by consuming imported food. Secondly, all of the exporting countries make money from providing food to other countries. Beside returning their profits back to contribute to the national economy, it could help them to promote their brands internationally and access more closely to foreigner customers. \\n On the other hand, due to distributing food to other countries, foreigner businesses have gained success in the worldwide market. However, this is also a factor that leads to less consumption of internal food in each country. Furthermore, It is inevitable that the higher requirements people have, the more easily poor imitations are produced. For example, when people order a huge number of oversea products, but not research carefully their origins and providers. Then, they could receive a lot of food with an unsafe standard and worsen their health too. \\n To sum up, I reckon that the increase in importing food almost has positive effects on both political and living grounds. Moreover, governments need to find solutions to better food problems, which involve low quality food, harmful chemicals in food, etc.","human_feedback_text":"The use of the word \" consequences\" is incorrect in the first paragraph.This is improper ' word usage based on lexical meaning: \\n Consequences - root word: consequence; noun; the effect, result, or outcome of something occurring earlier: The accident was the consequence of reckless driving; implies a negative result. \\n The word should not have been used at all in that sentence as it is both evidence of incorrect word usage and grammar inaccuracy. \\n While the essay presents several strong reasons representing both sides, that was all the writer made an effort to do. There is no evidence of logic and reasoning presented in defense or support of the ideas provided. The essay does not clearly develop the believability of any provided discussion points through any explanations or examples.

This is a good start, but the essay could benefit from a more focused argument. Consider refining the thesis to clearly state your position on the topic. A clear thesis statement will guide the essay and make your viewpoint more evident.\n\n2. **Word Usage and Grammar:** The word \"consequences\" is not used appropriately. This term generally implies negative outcomes, which may not be the intent when discussing both the positive and negative aspects of food importation. Consider using a neutral word like \"outcomes\" or \"effects\" to accurately represent both sides. Additionally, watch for spelling errors (\"foreigner food\" should be \"foreign food\") and grammar mistakes. Phrases like \"distributing food to other countries, foreigner businesses have gained success\" could be clarified for better readability.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Author's Point of View:** While the essay attempts to present both sides of the issue, the concluding paragraph suggests a leaning towards the positive effects without fully explaining why. If the position is that the positive effects outweigh the negatives, it would be beneficial to more clearly justify this viewpoint with logic, reasoning, or evidence.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** The essay mentions several reasons for and against the importation of food but lacks depth in explaining and supporting these reasons. For instance, when discussing the improvement in international relations or health qualities due to imported food, including specific examples or data would strengthen the argument. Similarly, the mention of low-quality food imports harming health could be bolstered by evidence or more detailed explanation.\n\n5. **Development of Ideas:** Currently, the essay lists advantages and disadvantages without exploring them in depth. Developing each point with specific examples, evidence, and explanations will enhance the persuasiveness and credibility of the essay. Try to explain how and why importing food can have the effects you mention, rather than merely stating that these effects exist.\n\nIn summary, focusing on clarifying the thesis statement, refining grammar and word choice, explicitly stating the personal viewpoint, and providing specific examples and explanations to support arguments, will greatly improve the essay.

Ensuring proper sentence structure, punctuation, and consistent tense usage is key to creating a piece that is both easy to read and professionally presented. Consider using online grammar tools or seeking feedback from a teacher or peer to identify and correct these issues.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: While the essay does state a clear opinion, noting that the advantages of vehicle bans outweigh the disadvantages, this point of view could be strengthened. For a more persuasive argument, clearly introduce your thesis statement at the beginning of your essay and reiterate it in the conclusion for reinforcement.\n\n4. **Supporting Arguments**: The essay provides examples to support the argument, such as the implementation of vehicle restriction policies in the Philippines. However, for improved effectiveness, ensure that your examples directly relate to the essay's main topic and clearly highlight the benefits or drawbacks of allowing only buses, bicycles, and taxis in city centers. Adding more detailed comparisons between these modes of transportation and the general vehicle bans could offer a more robust and nuanced argument.\n\nIn summary, focus on closely adhering to the prompt, addressing all aspects of the topic, and providing clear, well-supported arguments. Enhancing the organization and coherence of the essay, while paying careful attention to grammar and style, will significantly improve its quality. Keep practicing, and use these points as a guide for your next essay assignment."}

Discuss the problems associated with fast fashion and propose solutions to address these issues. \\n In recent years, the fast fashion industry has become increasingly popular in many countries. However, this trend has also brought with it a problem that need to be addressed. This essay will discuss the problem associated with fast fashion and propose a solution to this issue. \\n One of the major problems with fast fashion is its impact on water resources due to its unsustainable practices. The dyeing and finishing of textiles uses a wide range of chemicals, including dyes, mordants, and auxiliaries which are toxic. When they are not properly treated and disposed of, these chemicals can run off into rivers and streams, contaminating the water supply. For example, formaldehyde, a poisonous dyeing chemical, when being discharged into bodies of water from textile mills without a process of removing contaminants, they can pollute rivers, lakes, and oceans. \\n To address these issues, one solution can be proposed. It is essential that clothing companies treat wastewater from textile mills before it is discharged into the environment using biological treatment. This method uses microorganisms to break down and remove pollutants from wastewater by using them as a food source. When bacteria come into contact with pollutants in wastewater, they consume them and produce new cells. This process is called biodegradation. Biodegradation can break down a wide variety of pollutants, including organic matter, nutrients, and toxic chemicals. For instance, when bacteria are exposed to pollutants in wastewater, they use oxygen to break down pollutants into simpler compounds, such as carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen gas which are then released into the environment or used by the bacteria to build new cells. \\n In conclusion, while the fast fashion industry has gained significant popularity, it also comes with a problem that need to be addressed. By adopting more sustainable and ethical practice, companies can create a more sustainable and responsible fashion industry.","human_feedback_text":"You should not use the same phrase \"fast fashion\" in the presentation because that makes it appear that you just copied and pasted the original information. You could have said short wear clothes or disposable fashion to show that you have a wider vocabulary that would allow you refer to the same topic in an original way. The writer's opinion cannot be given a passing score as you merely repeated the writing instruction instead of delivering your thesis statement in the process. Without a properly developed thesis statement, you were not able to meet the writer's opinion presentation requirement. \\n Another problem in the essay is that you presented only 1 problem in the first paragraph. The second topic is not related to fashion so it deviated from the topic. So that will lower the score of the paragraph. The same problem exists in your solution presentation. Basically, the deviations and lack of thesis statement will be the reasons for the essay to fail.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay focuses on the significant issue of the fast fashion industry and its impact on water resources, a relevant topic in today\u2019s environmental discussions. However, there are several areas where improvements could greatly enhance the effectiveness and quality of the essay.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:**\n   - The essay correctly identifies fast fashion as a significant problem but focuses primarily on water pollution. Expanding on the variety of issues caused by fast fashion, such as waste accumulation and labor exploitation, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Additionally, ensure that all parts of the essay are directly related to the fast fashion industry to maintain focus and relevance.\n\n2. **Vocabulary and Expression:**\n   - There is a tendency to repetitively use the term \u201cfast fashion\u201d throughout the essay. Utilizing synonyms or related terms, such as \"disposable fashion\" or \"quick-style clothing,\" could enrich the vocabulary and demonstrate a broader linguistic range. This would also make the essay more engaging and less repetitive.\n\n3. **Clarity of Author\u2019s Position:**\n   - The essay lacks a clear thesis statement that presents your unique perspective or argument about fast fashion. A strong thesis statement is crucial as it guides the structure of your essay and informs readers of your specific angle on the topic. Clarifying your stance will not only fulfill the requirement for presenting the writer\u2019s opinion but also anchor your arguments throughout the essay.\n\n4. **Argumentation and Support:**\n   - While the essay includes a detailed explanation of how wastewater affects water resources, it's important to ensure that all arguments directly support the main thesis, focusing specifically on fast fashion. Diversifying the problems discussed and linking them clearly to your thesis statement will strengthen your argumentation. \n   - In proposing solutions, the essay would benefit from exploring a wider range of possible interventions beyond wastewater treatment. Considering alternatives like promoting sustainable materials or encouraging consumer behavior change could make your argument more robust and descriptive.\n\n5. **Grammar and Style:**\n   - The essay demonstrates a good command of language but be mindful of grammatical issues such as subject-verb agreement, e.g., \u201cthis trend has also brought with it a problem that need to be addressed\u201d should be \u201cneeds to be addressed.\u201d \n   - Additionally, varying sentence structure and using transitional phrases would enhance the flow and coherence of the essay.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The concluding paragraph reiterates the main points but could be strengthened by summarizing the solutions more effectively and re-emphasizing the importance of addressing the issues with fast fashion. A forward-looking statement about the potential positive impact of the proposed solutions could provide a compelling end to the essay.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on clarity of argument, enhancing vocabulary, and providing a more comprehensive analysis of the fast fashion industry and its multifaceted problems will significantly improve the essay. Remember, a well-structured essay with a clear stance and diverse vocabulary can effectively convey your message and engage your readers."}

Another positive aspect that it is a beneficial way which should be encouraged them to be as self-reliant as possible, this boosts their self-esteem. For instance, teenagers live in unstable families, due to such issues as unemployment or political chaos, take a job makes them have independent income to support their families. \\n On the other hand, there are several pitfalls to working outside when the youth continued to study at school. One definite drawback of taking a job is they will ignore and lose the habit of enhancing knowledge. This is because they just focus on earning money as much as possible and decrease their passion for learning. Furthermore, it can be seen that young people do not have enough experiences and skills to go to work.

This approach will make your position clearer to the readers from the beginning.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Though the essay has a good flow, there are a few grammatical errors and stylistic choices that could be improved.

On the one hand, opponents of capital punishment agree that it should be forbidden, whereas proponents can point to a number of equally arguments in favor of the death sentence. \\n From the pro-life viewpoint, it is morally wrong for a government to execute its own citizens, and the death penalty is an ineffective deterrent. Indeed, there is inconclusive evidence to show that it deters people from committing horrific crimes. For example, in the USA pro-death penalty states do not have lower murder rates. In addition, pro-life lobbyists point to the fact that while poor people are over-represented in death penalty statistics, rich people often pay their way out of trouble with clever lawyers. Consequently, innocent poor people could be unjustly executed, whereas some culpable rich people might escape justice. Thus unless a legal system is flawless, capital punishment ought to be illegal. \\n Despite the above arguments, advocates of capital punishment would argue that executing murderers and serial killers is justified. To begin with, if a criminal murders someone, then the victim's family ought to expect a punishment that is proportionate to the convicted killer's crime, which will help the bereaved family to find 'closure' and move on with their shattered lives. Moreover, it is unfair to expect taxpayers to pay for convicted murderers, rapists, and serial killers to live in prison for life. For instance, it costs the U.S. taxpayers approximately $100.000 a year to keep a lifer in a high-security prison. Finally, while D.N.A and forensics have made it less likely for innocent people to be convicted, some dangerous killers have escaped or been released from prison and killed successively. \\n On balance, it is my opinion that if somebody has been proven beyond all reasonable doubt to have intentionally murdered another citizen, then the punishment should be equal to their crime. Therefore, in order for justice to be fair, I believe that the death penalty ought to be applied to the most evil of crimes.","human_feedback_text":"The prompt restatement should not include a reference to the global scale of death penalty agreement as that is not indicated in the original prompt topic or reason. As that is the writers personal opinion, it should be presented elsewhere in the appropriate discussion paragraphs. It must also be pointed out that the lack of the writers clear opinion atthe end of this paragraph makes it incomplete since the paragraph is scored on the prompt restatement + writers opinion consideration. The lack of the latter means the scoring consideration will be incomplete for that section. \\n This is a 5 paragraph essay. There needs to be 3 reasoning paragraphs + 1 conclusion. Without a proper concluding summary, the essay could automatically garner a failing score due to an incorrect discussion format.

This approach is commendable as it showcases your ability to explore differing perspectives. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the overall effectiveness and clarity of your essay.\n\n1. **Relevance to the Topic:** Your introduction briefly touches upon the global application of the death penalty but emphasizes the differing opinions on its use. While mentioning the global perspective is informative, it's important to ensure that your opening statement directly addresses the essay topic. Additionally, your personal stance on the topic should be clearly stated in the introduction. This omission makes it challenging to fully understand your position from the outset.\n\n2. **Essay Structure:** The current essay consists of well-developed paragraphs that explore arguments on both sides. However, the essay would benefit from a more structured format that includes three reasoning paragraphs followed by a solid conclusion. The lack of a concluding paragraph is a significant oversight. A conclusion serves to summarize your key points and restates your stance, providing a clear ending to your argument. Without it, the essay feels incomplete and may not meet the requirements of a standard essay format, potentially affecting your score.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Overall, the essay is well-written with minimal spelling or grammatical errors.

While some people argue that this could result in a thriving society, others claim that tuition waiver can put a strain on the economy. In my opinion, I partly advocate the decision to pursue college without fee. \\n There are many compelling reasons why students should be allowed to waive tuition. On the individual level, tuition waivers provide students a number of advantages. Students can easily get access to higher education. And as a result, especially the underprivileged will stand a better chance of landing on a steady job and bettering their living condition. However, the abolition of university tuition may have a negative impact on student's academic performance. As today most undergraduates have to pay for their education, they are bound to study harder and apply themselves to getting good grades. Therefore, were this financial pressure to be dispensed with, students can be indifferent to their study and lose their motivation to work hard. Due to their thought that failing an exam doesn't cost them anything. \\n On the other hand, the provision of free-of-charge education may exert positive effect on a country's economy. A surge in the gross enrollment rate, prompted by a free-college policy, would trigger a more educated workforce, which results in a thriving society. Let's take Singapore as a telling example. Thanks to their heavy investment in education, they now have the most skillful working labours.

My essay will clarify the two opinions and state my point of view \\n On the one hand, people with natural aptitudes are believed to perform in a specific field better than others. People who are born with talents such as drawing or writing can learn skills in these fields effectively with less effort. It is not difficult to see that many outstanding artists or scientists showed their talents since their childhood. And the inborn ability of a person is something that cannot be taught or learned in any school. \\n On the other hand, people having no special talents can also make achievement. It is said that practice makes perfect, children can learn how to play sports or play musical instruments in their schools, and if they practice what they learn regularly, they can gain more experience than other children, which makes their performance more professional. However, if those with natural ability do not spend time practicing and training, their talents cannot develop fully. \\n In my opinion, a performance of a person is a combination of talents and practice. Because without those without aptitudes can hardly be as excellent as those who own one, moreover, their practice cannot be as productive as others.

You have a problem using connecting words. You don't use the words and, be, where, a, and other connecting reference words. Which is why your grammar is not very good and your sentence structure is very poor in every line. \\n Another grammar issue is your problem with word capitalization. While you did capitalize the name of Saeed and Ali, you should have also capitalized the name Jerry, even if the name belongs to your pet. It is still a proper noun and needs to be written as such. You are also prone to redundancies. Asking your friend to feed the cat twice a day implies a morning and evening feeding unless otherwise specified. Your last sentence in that paragraph needs to be capitalized at the start. \\n You do not water a flower. You water THE flowers. FYI, you do not ever ask a friend to pay for your bills.

Here are some points to help improve your writing:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: Your essay does a good job at addressing the prompt by listing out the tasks needed to be done in your absence. However, it reads more like a list of commands rather than a friendly request for assistance. Remember, the tone in which we write to friends should be polite and appreciative.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are several areas where your grammar and sentence structure could be improved. For instance, the use of connecting words such as \"and\", \"be\", \"where\", and articles like \"a\" is missing, which affects the flow and coherence of your sentences. Capitalization is another area needing attention; proper nouns, including the names of people and pets (like \"Jerry\"), should always be capitalized. Also, pay attention to redundant phrases; if you mention feeding is twice a day, you do not need to specify morning and evening unless there's a special requirement. Furthermore, instead of saying \"water the flower\", it's more accurate to say \"water the flowers\" to imply there are multiple. Lastly, the way situations are presented could be more precise and grammatically correct, for example, \"Always lock the door and check all the locks in the house before leaving for the office.\"\n\n3. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view as the author is clear. You've outlined what you need from your friend during your absence. It could be enhanced by expressing gratitude and explaining the importance or reason behind certain tasks, making the letter feel more personal and less commanding.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: While you've listed what needs to be done, there's room to explain why these tasks are important. For example, detailing a bit about Jerry's needs or the reason to avoid leaving cooked food out could engage your reader (Ali) more and make them more willing to help. Adding personal touches or explanations can transform a list of chores into a conversation between friends.\n\nIn conclusion, your essay has a clear purpose and addresses the topic well. With attention to grammar, sentence structure, tone, and personal engagement, it can be significantly improved. Remember to write as if you are speaking to a friend, with kindness and appreciation, as this will make your requests more well-received."}

To abandon such places, first and foremost, would evoke fierce opposition from residents of area. This is because the long-aged sites have existed since time immemorial and witness the advancement of civilisation, thereby earning acclaim from individuals and even being connected with certain fairy tales in some cases.

Responding to the Topic: It's crucial to directly answer the question posed by the topic at the very start of your essay. While you mention that you will provide your perspective, you don't clearly state your position in the introduction. To improve, specify your viewpoint early on to guide the reader through your argumentation.\n\n2. Spelling, Grammar, and Style: Your essay contains some spelling errors (e.g., \"old-aging dereclit\" should be \"aging, derelict\") and grammatical inaccuracies. Additionally, phrases like \"all sectors or life\" may confuse readers; a more accurate expression might be \"various sectors of society.\" Simplifying your language and carefully proofreading could significantly enhance readability and precision.\n\n3.

Stating your opinion more explicitly at the beginning and reinforcing it throughout would strengthen your essay. This clarity will help ensure the reader knows where you stand on the issue.\n\n4. Descriptive Arguments: You do well to provide examples and rationales for both preserving old buildings and constructing new ones.

For example, when discussing the cultural value of preserving buildings, directly tie this back to your stance on the importance of maintaining cultural identity over economic gains.\n\nTo address the feedback on not all individuals being equally invested in the architecture and preservation of old buildings, consider narrowing your focus to the perspectives of stakeholders directly influenced by these decisions, such as local communities, historians, and urban planners. This approach can make your argument more relevant and grounded.\n\nIn summary, your essay has a strong foundation, touching on critical issues surrounding urban development and cultural preservation. By directly stating your viewpoint, refining your language for clarity and accuracy, and more closely aligning your arguments with your thesis, you can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your essay. Engaging more deeply with the nuances of the topic, such as considering the varied interests of stakeholders, will also add depth to your discussion."}

However, there are areas for improvement to ensure that it fully meets the expectations for an English proficiency test essay. Here are some specific points of feedback:\n\n1. **Response to Topic:** Your essay touches on how music connects people from diverse cultures and generations, which aligns with the general topic of music\u2019s societal role. However, the essay lacks a direct response to a specific question or an extent of agreement or disagreement with a given statement. To improve, ensure that your essay directly addresses the prompt by clearly stating your position in relation to it. If the prompt asks for your extent of agreement, clearly articulate whether you strongly agree, somewhat agree, disagree, and so on, and structure your essay around this stance.\n\n2. **Structure and Clarity:** The essay has long paragraphs that juggle multiple ideas simultaneously, which can dilute the clarity and strength of your arguments. Try breaking down paragraphs into singular, focused discussions that expand on one main idea at a time. This will help in making your argumentation more coherent and easier to follow. For instance, separate discussions about the cross-cultural impact of music and its ability to transcend generational boundaries into individual paragraphs.\n\n3. **Development of Ideas:** While you provide examples, such as the popularity of K-pop in Vietnam, your essay would benefit from deeper exploration and explanation of these examples. Discuss how these examples support your main argument and link back to the essay\u2019s overall thesis.

While a number of people believe that the increase of using common languages can bring many economics benefits to most nations, others think that the usage of less well-known languages which are being declined can result in some related-culture problems. In my opinion, the disappearing of some languages in the world has negative effects since it not only contributes to the losing cultural diversity but also causes inequalities for many lower-speed developing countries. \\n To begin with, language has always been considered as an effective tool that brings people around the world together through the exchange of culture and history. However, as languages such as English or Chinese are being used more often for global purposes, many traditional ways of communication seem to be forgotten. Indeed, in the face of global linguistic homogenization it is hard for the indigenous people to retain their knowledge and so as the lost of their cultural values. For example, a cure for cancer which is known as cliche, is an affective element that can be found in the Amazon rain forest. However, many pharmaceutical companies do not know this kind of remedy because the name is called by the shamans language, for this reason, a large amount of resources were spent to find another solution for the disease. Another example is that when the languages of local people can not reach the knowledge of other nations around the world, their culture will easily be forgotten . In the multi-ethnic society, people tend to use common languages for gaining benefits and exchanging culture. On the other hand, when some languages are unfamiliar to many individuals, its origins and cultural values can be ignored. \\n Last but not least, this way of communicating can result in a large number of inequalities for aboriginal people. Using well-known language like English can bring up advantages for multinational company including Microsoft and Google. As a result, these traders can have a better connection to their partners, becoming more successful in their business. On the other hand, the contracts for the clients not knowing English will be hard to operated as the directors can not understand the native language which brings less economic incomes for the local nations. Furthermore, the gap between rich and developing countries will be widen which causes the increasing of inequality for lower-speed developing nations. \\n In short, the massively speaking of common languages instead of others is considered to have negative effects on the fair development of countries around the world.","human_feedback_text":"Oh boy...

Explain the reasons and give solutions.","essay_text":"Throughout centuries, gender discrimination has always remained to be one of the most controversial topics, which could be especially witnessed in the STEM field. Thus, it must be addressed and resolved immediately as it poses as an obstacle to the advent of human society. \\n The fact that women construct only about 20% of students in physical science, computer science, math and engineering in the U.S perfectly display this situation. Women who work in STEM fields are reported to receive more gender disparity at work. This problem is induced by several reasons. Firstly, it is undeniable that societal mindset is an instrumental factor which leads to gender inequality. How society determines the value of women and men has a crucial effect on gender inequality. Notably in STEM fields, where men are considered to be superior in terms of intelligence, women frequently experience discrimination. Furthermore, women were supposed to stay home and take care of family matters. Although that prejudice has been weakened, most underdeveloped countries remain unchanged which lower women's opportunity to learn new things. Secondly, there have been durable attitudes in some countries that heavily male-dominated STEM careers are not suitable for women. Generally, art, literature, humanities and design are regarded as what women should be specialized in. Sometimes, girls are denied the opportunities to learn and major in STEM by schools and universities, which results in the fact that STEM career path contains extreme drawbacks to female. \\n This magnificent problem requires prompt actions to be taken. First and foremost, societal mindset about female needs to be modified immediately and completely. Educational system in countries should play a crucial role in the fight against gender disparity, especially in the STEM field. Courses edifying women's value and that people share alternative ability or extent of intelligence does not depend on sexes should be organized several times a year. Numerous women have proved that they have the capability to accomplish the same amount of work as men. Furthermore, some women have done beyond that: Marie Quyri - the conductor of pioneering research on radioactivity or Helen Keller, who lost her sight, hearing and was mute altogether, but she grew to be an admirable person and a philanthropist. Secondly, women should be given the opportunities to achieve various types of education. It has to be widely comprehended that women should be educationally invested as well as men. Fortunately, gender discrimination has been recognized, for instance, in the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action and the Education 2030 Framework for Action, National development strategies often highlight boosting women's participation in STEM as key steps to facilitate transition to high-tech, knowledge-base, as well as to abolish unfairness. \\n In conclusion, gender inequality in STEM field is caused by erroneous societal mindset and the imbalance in the amount of education that each sex receives. In order to tackle this serious situation, people's awareness about women's value should been intensified especially through educational methods. These actions have to be made so that women would earn a fairer and more secured future.","human_feedback_text":"You cannot claim that gender discrimination has been a problem \"throughout centuries\" as the claim regarding gender discrimination is a 20th century ideology.

For instance, saying gender discrimination has been a problem \"throughout centuries\" can mislead, as the discussion surrounding it, particularly in the context provided, has gained prominence in more recent times. It's more constructive to present information cautiously, using phrases like \"To the best of my knowledge\" or \"It appears that,\" especially when empirical evidence from cited sources is not provided. This approach adds credibility to the arguments.\n\n2. **Use of Language**: The essay occasionally employs a sensationalized tone, which can detract from its academic quality. Phrases that might imply controversy or sensationalism, where there might not be, can alienate educated readers expecting a scholarly discussion. Strive for a balanced, informed tone that reflects careful consideration and respect for the complexity of the issues discussed. This means focusing on presenting your discussion with clarity and precision, rather than emphasizing dramatic language.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: The essay demonstrates a good command of English, but there are minor issues that need attention for clearer communication. Pay close attention to sentence structure and punctuation to ensure that your arguments are presented as effectively as possible. For stylistic improvement, consider varying sentence length and structure to maintain reader engagement and emphasize key points.\n\n4. **Clarity of Point of View**: The essay's standpoint is clear, advocating for immediate action to address gender discrimination in STEM. However, ensuring that each argument thoroughly supports this standpoint will strengthen the essay. When presenting solutions or criticisms, clearly connecting these back to the main argument will help maintain focus and coherence throughout.\n\n5. **Supporting Arguments**: While the essay presents arguments supporting the need to tackle gender discrimination in STEM, these could be enhanced by more specific examples, data, and potential counterarguments. Incorporating evidence from credible sources or citing specific studies would substantiate the claims made. Additionally, addressing potential counterarguments can provide a more rounded and persuasive discussion by anticipating and rebutting possible criticisms.\n\nBy refining these areas, the essay will not only meet academic expectations but also present a compelling and well-supported argument on an important issue."}

While I agree that people do prioritize enjoyment at the festival, I disagree with the view that they have forgotten the festival's meaning. \\n On the one hand, after a year of hard work, people look forward to festivals as a time to relax and take a break from busy life. For example, religious festivals like Christmas are often be seen as an excuse to party and shop, with people costume like Santa greetings in front of malls and playing with children. Similar behavior could be seen during some non-religious festivals, such as the Vietnamese Lunar New Year when all of the Vietnamese students are allowed to be absent from school, and their parent does not have to work, they often gathering around and decorating their homes, giving and receiving presents, as well as buying new clothes. \\n On the other hand, I do not agree with the idea that the original meaning of festivals has been forgotten. This is because at an early age, Vietnamese offsprings have known about the meaning of their festivals and culture through their family. Additionally, in primary school, the teacher would tell students stories about the legend and the history of these festivals.

Also, aim for more varied sentence structures to enhance readability and engagement.\n\n5. **Supporting Your Position**: Your examples are a good start in illustrating your points; however, they could be more descriptive and directly linked to your argument. When discussing traditions being passed down through generations, provide specific instances that clearly demonstrate how these traditions contribute to remembering the festivals' meanings.\n\nIn conclusion, refining your stance on the essay topic, ensuring originality in your phrasing, strengthening your argument development, correcting grammatical issues, and enhancing the clarity of your examples will greatly improve the quality of your essay. Focus on these areas to better convey your insights and achieve a more effective and persuasive response."}

The primary cause of this phenomenon is the underestimation local people feel for these places and the most viable solution is an organization of events encouraging people to go to historical sites. \\n The principal cause leading to the shortage of local visitors is that they do not feel the need to visit the historical and cultural sites in their towns. As local monuments have already been familiar with citizens, they might find it boring to visit these places. As a result, they could influence their friends and families that local sites do not bring any value to their lives. For instance, a recent government survey found that 75% of people in Ha Noi refused to choose Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum as their destination because they found nothing exciting out there. \\n To tackle this problem, the government should hold special events, such as conventional games or festival at the monuments to motivate locals to visit these places. Organizing popular events could shed some light on this difficult situation and allow people to be more concerned about it. To illustrate, a similar initiative in China resulted in a 52% increase in the number of local visitors to important spots in their cities. \\n In conclusion, the number of foreign visitors is greater than that of local people in several historical and cultural places since locals tend to underestimate the value of these places. However, it can be addressed through conducting a variety of special programs there to stimulate local visitors.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, good work on writing 200 words for this essay. That sort of word count can definitely increase your chances of getting a higher score because you have a better opportunity of proving your abilities in the LR, C&C, and GRA sections of the essay. However, the GRA and TA section will not have a marked increase in scoring because you did not meet the 3 sentence minimum in some instances of the paragraphs within your essay. Always work towards meeting the maximum 5 sentence requirement per paragraph in order to better increase your overall chances. The way that you wrote the essay shows a clear understanding of the prompt. Although, this understanding had a little problem when it came to consistency in the presentation of your discussion. In the opening statement, you mentioned the locals at the start, then merely said \"people\" later on in the paragraph. \"Locals\" and \"people\" are two different things since \"people\" can refer to anyone. The correct term would have been \"local people\" in order to remain prompt specific and thus, increase your score.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay presents a thoughtful discussion on why locals might underestimate the value of places in their own areas and offers a solution to this issue. You've managed to stay on topic and bring forward relevant examples and solutions, which demonstrates a clear understanding of the essay prompt. However, there are several areas in which your essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.\n\n1. **Response to Topic and Clarity of Point of View**: You've chosen a relevant topic and your point of view is apparent. However, the clarity of your argument could be enhanced by consistently referring to the group you're discussing. Initially, you use \"locals\" but then switch to \"people,\" which might cause confusion. For clarity and to stay focused on the essay prompt, consistently use \"local people\" throughout your essay.\n\n2. **Paragraph Structure**: Aim for a minimum of three sentences per paragraph, with an ideal target of five sentences. This structure supports clearer and more developed ideas. Some paragraphs fall short of this, limiting the depth of your analysis. Expanding your paragraphs will not only help demonstrate your language skills but also allow you to provide more evidence and explanation for your ideas.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: While your essay has few spelling errors, there are some grammatical and stylistic areas that need attention. For instance, maintaining a formal tone is crucial in essays like this. Avoid contractions (e.g., use \"do not\" instead of \"don't\") and ensure verb tense consistency. Also, watch out for run-on sentences, and consider breaking them into simpler, clearer sentences.\n\n4. **Support for Arguments**: Your essay includes an example and a suggested solution, which are both strong points. However, further description and evidence for your arguments could improve your essay. Consider adding more examples, statistics, or hypothetical scenarios to make your arguments more persuasive and descriptive.\n\n5. **Grammar and Vocabulary**: Your essay could benefit from a wider range of vocabulary and more complex sentence structures. This not only demonstrates your language ability but also makes your argument more compelling. However, ensure clarity is not sacrificed for complexity.\n\nBy addressing these suggestions, your essay will have clearer arguments, better structure, and improved language use, making your points more convincible and engaging to the reader.

Therefore, people believe that there should be more emphasis on the construction of new buildings. From my personal perspective, I totally disagree with this opinion and will give my reasons below. \\n Many old buildings are considered as the world's historical attractions, which make great contributions to the tourism industry of the economy. That is why it can be inferred that the destruction of these buildings can be equivalent to a hard blow in the industry. Taj Mahal - an ancient castle built in India is a clear example for this claim. It is widely known as a mausoleum and praised by the UNESCO as a heritage site that needs protection. Due to the timeless beauty and historical importance this building attaches, it has attracted thousands of tourists from all over the globe every year and contributed greatly as India's national treasure. Thus, the loss of this wonder means a significant damage to the economy in India, proving that old buildings can play an important role in the tourism industry. \\n In other case, ancient buildings can signify great sentimental values; the irreplaceable charm that modern houses cannot be compared to. This emotion, such as patriotism, can stem from the significance that these buildings have. In Vietnam, the house on 48 Hang Ngang Street brings national pride, as it is the place where our first president wrote the \"Declaration of Independence\", thus ending years of slavery and opening a new era of liberty in the country. Throughout time, this house has turned into a small museum, where a handful of important historical documents from the time of war are preserved. \\n In conclusion, I disagree that there should be more attention to modern buildings, because old buildings can also contribute significantly to the economy and reminisce great memories of the past.","human_feedback_text":"The essay prompt is talking about old buildings in general. There was no reference to historical buildings and UNESCO Heritage Sites. Whatever gave you the impression that you should be discussing these buildings in this essay, which are protected buildings and as such have a restoration, renovation, and maintenance budget every year ? The discussion refers to simple buildings that were built in the olden times. For example, a 6 storey walk-up building , that does not have any historical significance and was built in 1973 (20th century) would be too expensive to maintain and repair in the 21st century. While still usable, such a building requires heavy maintenance costs because of the need to upgrade the building to modern architectural and safety standards. Do you think that type of building needs to be maintained? Or would it be better to build a new building in its place instead? Remember, historical buildings will never be in danger of going decrepit and the fact that the building is obsolete has no relation to its maintenance budget and whether it will remain standing or not. Its historical significance will indicate it can never be torn down. \\n Phrase number 2 that examiners hate reading: \"will give my reasons below\". This is considered to be a memorized phrase learned during IELTS lessons. Don't use it in practice tests so you won't use it during the actual test. Try to use a different sentence structure. You could instead say \"Based on personal reasons, I have to strongly disagree with this statement.\" Or something similar. Just don't use memorized phrases in any part of the presentation. \\n You only have 40 minutes to write this essay. You are constantly writing too many words. Don't go over 5 sentences per paragraph. You need to show the examiner that you can explain yourself clearly using less words. As long as you write between 250-290 words, you will be able to get the best possible score. Why? Consider that you will be able to double check your presentation by writing a median number of words. The focus is on the meaning of your paragraph and the speed by which you can explain yourself in English. Qualities an ESL student must display while in class. Write more than the advised word count and you will certainly be including irrelevant information in your essay. Something you have been doing ever since in your Task 2 writing tasks. \\n \"These\" is the plural form of \"this\". in the noun phrase \"this building attaches\", your previous reference is for the plural form of buildings so use \"these\", not \"this\". That presentation represents a noun phrase disagreement. \\n I owe you a score from your previous essay. Let me score this one instead. Your writing skills in this essay could pull in a 4.5 It was the TA section that severely pulled down your score. It was caused by your reference to UNESCO and world heritage buildings and historical buildings in Vietnam within your discussion. Topics which were not related to the task being discussed. The topic was partially addressed in the sense that you responded correctly to the question posed. However, the response is leaning more on the tangential side. The concluding summary is incomplete in summarized information presentation. You still need 3-5 sentences there. Imagine that, even though you kept on writing, you still missed out on some scoring requirements. All because you focused on the number of words instead of quality of the presentation and required formatting elements. \\n Your grammar does not show any extreme grammar errors. You still have imperfect grammatical presentations but these do not affect the meaning and understanding of your sentences in relation to the paragraph. Good job ! Your GRA scores benefited from your ability to use complex and simple sentences along with proper punctuation usage. \\n However, the wordiness of your essay shows that you are unable to explain yourself in concise English terms. You over explain in the essay, which could be a problem for you during the actual test. Use a timer, make sure you write within the 40 minute time limit. That includes review and editing time. If you can't do it, repeat the writing the essay. Keep repeating the essay until you write, review, and edit within 40 minutes.

Your ability to support your arguments with specific examples is a strength, enhancing the persuasive quality of your essay.\n\nOne area for improvement involves avoiding memorized phrases like \"will give my reasons below.\" This phrase can detract from the originality of your response.

Despite some obvious disadvantages of this trend, I strongly believe that these are outweighed by the advantages. \\n On the one hand, there are two major drawbacks when people decided to take a gap year. Firstly, the expense to go abroad these day are expensive due to plane tickets or living costs of a different country. For example, going to Australia from Vietnam would cost about 15-20 millions vn\u0111, not mentioning the living costs. Even working inland, the income from the jobs would not be sufficient enough to live independently thus adult still have to pay most of your expense. Secondly, a gap year will disrupt existing study habit since school is not a part of gap year. From studying to working then studying will make people feel overwhelmed by the constant changing environment. In addition, when coming back for a gap year, people tend to feel like they are slower and older than their friends who do not take a gap year. \\n On the other hand, I believe that the benefit are more significant than such disadvantages. One reason for this view is that, the experiences people get from a gap year is enormous. Take going abroad as an example, people will have to adapt to the new environment that they never seen before, have to meet with strangers of different languages, have to learn how to solve problems independently. From there, they will accumulate various skillset to use before becoming a student. Another reason for this is that, a gap year will prevent student from burning out and help them to perform better when studying in the university since they can feel free from stress. \\n In conclusion, it seems to me that the advantages of taking a short break or a gap year are more significant than the disadvantages. \\n (328w)","human_feedback_text":"Please note that you will not be able to write 328 words during the actual 40 minute test.

I have already attempted 3 times. Please help me by reviewing my answer below to above topic . \\n Answer: \\n the advertisements are not useful \\n The introduction of television was one of the major breakthrough during the 20th century. Originally the television which is also abbreviated as TV was used for the commercial purposes only, but, soon it got launched into the public domain. This was considered as a highly important milestone, as, this was the medium to reach out to the masses and communicate messages. \\n The capability of TV to reach out masses attracted a lot of people with business interest and they started to brainstorm- the possibility of positioning their products in the minds of populations using this new medium.

Though till date different sections of population debate on the usefulness of these advertisements to the end-users. \\n Some point-out, that, the advertisements are helpful as these help people learn about new products in the market, the information on location of a particular new hypermarket, health products, etc. They also serve as useful breaks for someone who might like to stretch in between watching a movie just to ensure the enough levels of physical activity. \\n While other argue, if, there is someone who wishes to buy a product or a service, he or she does not need an advertisement to know about the same. The information can be researched using the internet. Also, they point out that the advertisements waste precious time of a person who has actually bought a paid subscription and is enjoying a movie. In literal terms as time is considered money. It's either the advertisers help me save my time or my money. May be they can pay for my subscription and then they are free to use some of my time. \\n Besides, one can imagine, the impact on psychic state of a child watching a cola advertisement, where, his favorite hero is doing stunts after two sips of the cola. \\n Considering the various reasons, in my opinion, the advertisements are not really useful and policies should be implemented in order to discontinue the existing trend.","human_feedback_text":"There is a clear noun-phrase disagreement in this section of your essay : \"... major breakthrough during the 20th century.\" Since there wasn't just one breakthrough during that century, you should be presenting that word in its plural form; \"breakthroughs\".

However, there are several areas that need improvement for a better score in IELTS writing. Let's go over them in detail:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: The essay deviates significantly from the prompt's requirements. The prompt asks to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of TV advertisements, as well as to provide your own opinion. Instead, your essay focuses on the history and impact of television's introduction, which is not directly related to the prompt. Focusing closely on what the prompt asks is crucial. To improve, ensure that you directly address the prompt by discussing both views provided and clearly stating your own opinion with relevant examples.\n\n2. **Grammar and Style**:\n   - There's a grammar issue with noun-phrase agreement. Instead of \"the major breakthrough during the 20th century,\" it should be \"major breakthroughs.\" \n   - The use of commas needs attention. For example, there's no need for a comma between \"only\" and \"but\" in your sentence about the original use of television.\n   - Your essay could benefit from shorter, clearer sentences and more natural transitions between ideas, making it easier to follow.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your essay does hint at a point of view towards the end that advertisements are not useful. However, this opinion comes after much discussion irrelevant to the prompt. It's important to make your stance clear from the beginning and consistently support it with arguments throughout the essay.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: While you provide various reasons why advertisements might be seen as unnecessary, these discussions should directly tie back to the prompt more clearly. Your essay would greatly improve by discussing arguments for and against TV advertisements specifically, followed by a clear statement of your personal view and supporting this with concrete examples from your experience.\n\n**Specific Recommendations to Improve**:\n- Start your essay by directly addressing the prompt: Acknowledge that some people see benefits in TV advertisements while others do not, and then state your thesis.\n- Organize your essay into five paragraphs as suggested: introduction, two paragraphs discussing each view on TV advertisements, one paragraph for your personal viewpoint (supported by specific examples), and a concluding summary.\n- Pay careful attention to grammar, particularly noun-phrase agreement and the correct use of punctuation.\n- Familiarize yourself with typical essay structures for IELTS writing tasks.

In academic or summary writing, it's important to stick to the facts and avoid inserting personal viewpoints unless explicitly asked for an opinion. It would be beneficial to rework the concluding paragraph to reflect solutions or conclusions drawn directly from the source material rather than personal suggestions.\n\n5. **Supporting Arguments:**\n   The essay mentions important concerns regarding counterfeit apps but does it without detailed support or evidence. Including more specific information or examples from the original article would strengthen the arguments. This involves addressing both the mechanisms by which companies are combating the issue and the role of consumers in ensuring their safety.\n\nIn summary, there\u2019s a strong basis for an informative essay here. Focusing on directly answering the question posed, using accurate and correct terminology, ensuring grammatical correctness, and sticking to objective summaries rather than personal opinions will greatly improve the essay. Reflecting on these points during revision will enhance the essay's effectiveness and clarity, providing a well-rounded response to the topic."}

However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the clarity, relevance, and overall effectiveness of your essay.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement and Introduction**: The introduction of your essay attempts to set the stage for your argument, mentioning the vastness of the cosmetic industry and the general trend of investing in beauty products. However, it lacks a complete thesis statement that should encapsulate not only the reason but also the result of the phenomenon you're discussing. A more structured introduction should include a topic restatement without adding new information, two related reasons for the phenomenon, and the expected outcomes of these reasons. This would provide a clearer roadmap for your essay.\n\n2. **Relevance of Arguments**: Your essay talks about charm and its perceived benefits in forming relationships and career opportunities. However, charm is more often associated with personality rather than mere physical attractiveness facilitated by cosmetics. It's important to maintain a focus on topics directly related to the cosmetic industry and its effects to stay aligned with the essay prompt. Ensure that your arguments directly support your thesis and relate closely to the cosmetic industry rather than straying into areas like inherent personality traits.\n\n3. **Connection Between Reasons and Results**: Throughout the essay, there are several reasons and results presented regarding the use of cosmetics. However, there isn't a clear linkage between these reasons and their consequent results. Moreover, the reasons and results themselves sometimes lack a coherent relationship with one another. Strengthening this aspect of your essay will require a closer examination of how each reason leads to specific results, ensuring that these connections are logically and clearly presented.\n\n4. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor issues with spelling, grammar, and style throughout the essay. For instance, \"themself\" should be corrected to \"themselves\" to agree in number with its antecedent, \"people\". Maintaining consistency in the use of singular and plural forms is essential. Additionally, attention should be paid to sentence structure to ensure clarity and readability.\n\n5. **Point of View Clarity**: Your point of view is identifiable but could be articulated more strongly with a more robust thesis statement and a clearer connection between your arguments and the overall thesis. Ensuring that each paragraph contributes directly to supporting your viewpoint will enhance the persuasiveness of your essay.\n\n6. **Descriptive Arguments**: While your essay does provide reasons behind the popularity of cosmetics, adding more descriptive and specific examples could strengthen your arguments. For instance, discussing specific trends or studies that demonstrate the benefits or drawbacks of cosmetics use would add credibility and depth to your analysis.\n\nIn summary, focusing on crafting a comprehensive thesis statement, ensuring the relevance and connection of your arguments, addressing minor grammatical issues, and providing more specific examples would significantly improve the quality of your essay. Remember, clarity and coherence are key to a compelling argumentative essay."}

Secondly, if the pollution only have severe impact on one country's people and environment and they can't find the country who want to help them, they have no choice but to solve the pollute issue alone by themselves. For example, some inland countries produce many pollute water and draw it to inland lake, because the pollution sites are far away from other countries, so the other country have no necessary to interfere with the problems. \\n In conclusion, solve the environmental by any person or country is welcome, but national cooperation is more important.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, if you say that the solution to the problem lies in a multilateral solution, then you must take the last paragraph of the opening statement to indicate the degree by which you believe that a multilateral solution is the best approach to the problem of pollution.

Since you already did a good job with the partial paraphrasing of the original discussion and instructions, adding the missing requirement will make the paragraph complete and more than acceptable. It will be impressive because it will prove your English comprehension skills immediately. If I were to present an opening statement for this topic, I would have presented it this way: \\n <em>Environmental problems are considered a global problem these days.

To strengthen the introduction, consider expanding the opening statement to more explicitly state that environmental issues require international collaboration for a comprehensive solution. This expansion will better set the stage for the arguments that follow and showcase your comprehension skills.\n\n2. **Spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues**: The essay contains some spelling, grammatical, and stylistic errors that could hinder clarity. For instance, \"due to the problems are not geologically isolated\" could be better expressed as \"because these problems are not geographically isolated.\" Also, be mindful of using the correct form of words (e.g., \"pollutions\" should be \"pollution,\" \"solve\" should be \"solving,\" and \"flue\" should be \"flow\"). Additionally, the first word of sentences should be capitalized, and look out for run-on sentences that make your points harder to follow. Simplify and clarify your language where possible, remembering to use transitions to smoothly connect ideas.\n\n3. **Point of view clarity**: Your point of view that multilateral collaboration is necessary to tackle environmental issues is clear throughout the essay. However, emphasizing your stance in the introduction and more decisively in the conclusion would provide a stronger, more persuasive argument.\n\n4. **Arguments and support**: You've done well to explain why global cooperation is essential, using examples such as cross-border pollution and the limitations of less developed countries in addressing environmental issues on their own. To enhance your essay, ensure that each point is thoroughly developed and supported with clear, specific examples. Additionally, the argument concerning countries solving pollution issues independently needs further development to offer a balanced view.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The concluding paragraph should be more than a brief statement; it needs to effectively summarize the key points made in your essay and restate your main argument. This not only helps reinforce your position but also demonstrates your ability to synthesize information and present it clearly, which is an essential skill in English writing.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you will not only correct existing issues but also elevate the overall quality of your essay, making your argument more compelling and your writing more clear and engaging."}

There are two choices when it comes to land transportation, which are railways and roads. While there are advantages to both options, I mostly agree that governments should invest more on railways rather than roads. This is due to the fact that railways are more reliable and and efficient, which makes it a better long-term investment. \\n With good maintenance and management, railways offer better reliability compared to roads. Take Japan for example, they have the most complicated railway system in the world while still being able to offer time precision on the order of seconds. On the other hand, roads are more susceptible to jamming when subjected to high volume of traffic. \\n Reliability is one of the most important measure to see how worthy a transportation system is. Without reliability there is no certainty, which means people cannot plan ahead their schedules. That is a disaster for industries whose projects success rely on timing. Fresh food suppliers, for example, highly depend on the reliability of its distribution network to make sure their goods arrive at the hand of their customers timely. \\n Other than being more reliable, railways are also more efficient compared to roads in the long run. Trains can transport more loads with less fuel and manpower which is better in economic and environmentally sense. This applies especially for electrical trains which power comes from renewable energy sources. Furthermore, considering the side effect of pollution that car brings in cities, railways are obviously the way to go for urban transportation. \\n Roads are more suitable to connect destinations with less traffic.

It gives several facts and details, with which the theories are inconsistent. \\n First, the lecture does not believe that only endotherms can live in the polar regions because of their ability to maintain their own body temperature, thus dinosaurs fossil found in Polar Regions indicates they belong to endotherms. That is because the climate of the period when dinosaurs lived in Polar Regions is warmer than nowadays so that the dinosaurs would not be bothered with cold climates. What's more, even during the cold period, the dinosaurs could migrate to other regions or hibernate like other reptiles do. Therefore, living in Polar Regions could not prove that dinosaurs are endotherms. \\n Second, even though the reading passage suggests that endotherms have their legs under their body in order to sustain agile physical activity, so the fact that the dinosaurs' legs are positioned underneath their body suggests they are endotherms, the professor argues in the lecture that the reason why the dinosaurs' legs under their body is to add their own weight, rather than supporting activities like running. That is because the bigger a dinosaur can grow, the stronger power it would appear, which means the dinosaurs had no needs to run. Obviously, the professor's argument contradicts its counterpart in the reading. \\n Third, although many dinosaur bones do have Haversian canal like most of the endotherms , it doesn't prove that the dinosaurs were not always rapidly growing, whereas that fact that the growth rings which the dinosaurs have confirms the frequent fluctuating growing pace of the dinosaurs which is consistent with the characteristic of non-endotherm animals.

Here's how to enhance your essay further, focusing on responsiveness to the topic, clarity, and support of arguments:\n\n1. **Responsiveness to Topic:**\n   - Your essay does contribute to the debate on whether dinosaurs were endotherms or ectotherms, which is related to the topic of analyzing the lecture's critique of certain theories. Ensure your essay explicitly connects each counter-argument back to the main question of the dinosaurs\u2019 thermoregulation for a stronger stance on the given topic.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**\n   - Overall, your essay demonstrates a decent command of language. However, paying close attention to smoother transitions between ideas can improve readability. For instance, instead of jumping directly into your arguments, introduce them with sentences that prepare the reader for what\u2019s coming next.

Brief explanations of concepts like endotherms, ectotherms, and Haversian canals can make your essay more accessible.\n  \nBy focusing on these areas, your essay can become more persuasive and engaging. Your dedication to analyzing complex scientific theories is commendable, and with some adjustments for clarity and depth, your arguments will be even more compelling."}

Movie actors, singers, production staffs and crews are not earning from these free downloads. Furthermore, this act is not helping the entertainment industry to grow or continue in the future. This could result into less movies and music being produced because the income does not surpass the production cost. for example, a lot of trilogy movies have failed to continue because it has been pirated online and the gross income could not budget the future movies. \\n Another reason why it is a negative development is that a lot of these free files are not safe to download.

I want you to see which parts of the scoring should be considered your weak points. That way you can develop those sections on your way towards developing a 7.5 final score in the test. Let's get started: \\n TA - 5 \\n - Your discussion ideas and presentations are never fully developed in every paragraph. That is because you are trying to discuss more than one topic in the paragraph. The rule, which has always helped to garner the highest possible score for any of my students is that each paragraph should contain the following information in order to be considered well written: \\n 1. One topic sentence at the start of the paragraph \\n 2. One opposing argument to start off the opinion discussion. \\n 3. Supporting statement one based on popular information \\n 4. Supporting information based on personal knowledge \\n 5. An example that best showcases the topic sentence and discussion reasons. \\n The above format will always work best in the 3 body paragraph format which is meant to allow you to fully discuss your opinion and reasoning in relation to the topic provided. While others here prefer to write in a 4 paragraph format, that is not the best way to prove your ability to discuss in English.The 4 paragraph format does not allow you to showcase your English vocabulary. Neither does it allow you to write a mix of complex and simple sentences per paragraph. The 5 paragraph format is always, always, the best method to write these IELTS Task 2 essays. My students high rate of passing at an almost perfect score each time is proof of that. \\n The concluding part of this essay was alright but lacks a reiteration of your opinion to close the discussion. A proper summary conclusion includes a repeated statement of opinion from the writer in the end. \\n LR - 6 \\n - While you do have a good grasp of the English language, your vocabulary could be considered to be only at an intermediate level. You need to increase your vocabulary list with more advanced or intermediately advanced vocabulary in order to bring up your score. Using the technical references to computer discussions was a good touch that helped to increase your score. Doing more of that in succeeding practice tests should help to boost your scoring consideration both in the practice and actual test. \\n C&C - 6 \\n - The C&C score was affected by the limited vocabulary use in your essay. Your discussion is clear but your presentation seemed mechanical instead of natural sounding. So there were times that I felt like you were still in the process of revising your paragraph presentations when you suddenly decided to submit the essay for scoring. \\n GRA - 6 \\n - There were moments of carelessness in the typing of the essay. You had instances when you used lower case letters to kick off a sentence. The start of every sentence is always capitalized. You also had a problem in developing certain sentences: \\n <quotation>could not budget the future movies.<\/quotation> \\n - ... could not <b>produce the budget<\/b> for the future... \\n <quotation>there was one person in the UK who was stolen money on his bank...<\/quotation> \\n - ... money was stolen <b>FROM<\/b> his bank account.. \\n The GRA score requires you to have almost perfect English punctuation and grammar skills. So be very conscious of your sentence development in the presentation. This further shows that you are not yet at an advanced level of English proficiency which could cause problems for you one you become a student in the university.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"**Final Feedback on the Essay:**\n\nThis essay does a good job addressing the topic and presenting a clear point of view that free downloads of movies and songs from the internet are a negative development for society. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to strengthen your writing and better convey your arguments.\n\n1. **Essay Structure and Development:**\nYour essay would benefit from a more structured approach to each paragraph. Aim to include:\n   - A clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea.\n   - If possible, mention an opposing view to provide a comparison.\n   - Support your topic with general facts and specific personal knowledge or insights.\n   - Incorporate an example that clearly illustrates your point.\n\nThis structure helps in expanding your discussion and making your paragraphs more comprehensive and convincing. Also, remember that using a five-paragraph format (introduction, three body paragraphs, and conclusion) is effective in fully exploring your viewpoints. This not only showcases your ability to discuss the topic in depth but also displays your linguistic range.\n\n2. **Vocabulary and Expression:**\nThere's room to enhance your vocabulary to make your arguments more compelling and to demonstrate a higher level of English proficiency. Incorporating more advanced vocabulary, especially related to specific topics like technology, could make your essay more impactful.

Aim for a more natural progression of thoughts, making sure each sentence smoothly leads to the next. This can also be improved by diversifying your sentence structures, mixing complex and simple sentences to create a more engaging and easy-to-follow narrative.\n\n4. **Grammar and Accuracy:**\nPay close attention to basic grammar rules, such as capitalizing the first letter of each sentence and correctly constructing sentences to avoid misunderstandings. For instance, phrases like \"could not budget the future movies\" could be clarified to \"could not provide the budget for future movies,\" and \"there was one person in the UK who was stolen money on his bank account\" should be corrected to \"money was stolen from his bank account.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion of your essay should reiterate your main view more strongly to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Why? Effects on society? ( Jan, 2023) \\n It is observed that the number of students choosing science subjects in universities doesn't reach the desired amount in many nations these days. In this essay, I will explain the potential reasons behind this occurrence and its effects on the society. \\n There are several reasons why students tend to turn away from scientific subjects. First, with the growth of the economy around the world and globalization becoming more important, economic studies may have attracted more college students than science since they can see the potential in the subject. Moreover, science subjects may be viewed as less important because basic science knowledge that everyone needs to know to apply them in real life has already been taught in high school. Second, if science in university is high-level science, the students will only study it if they want to become a scientists. But, since not many scientists can create remarkable findings or make large contributions, their lives seem to be struggling, which demotivates people to follow that path. \\n As a consequence, there will be fewer scientists in the future to do research and invent scientific developments. The possibility of improving the lives of the people is lowered, so any societal problems will remain unsolved. Another effect is the creation of new medicine for unhealed diseases is slower or if worse, there will not be any chance there would be one. Therefore, the health of the citizens will be not improved despite possible worsening pollution and diseases. \\n In conclusion, the cause of the decline in science subject registration is the students' lack of interest in it and this may lead to societal problems being unresolved and citizen's health not improving.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>doesn't reach the desired amount in many nation<\/quotation> \\n This is a prompt point of view alteration that does not follow the intention of the original prompt.

However, there are areas for improvement to make your essay more effective.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** Your introduction suggests a significant drop in the number of students studying science subjects, but this presents a slightly different angle than what the prompt may be asking. Your interpretation shifts the focus slightly away from the prompt's original intention. When addressing the essay topic, it's crucial to stay aligned with what is asked, ensuring your response directly answers the question without altering its original meaning.\n\n2. **Clarity and Arguments:** The essay states potential causes and effects but lacks in-depth explanation and examples. Expanding on each cause and effect with more detailed information and specific examples would strengthen your arguments. For instance, discussing how economies grow and globalization influences study preferences could be enriched by mentioning specific trends, statistics, or studies. Similarly, when discussing the impact on scientist population and public health, adding data or potential scenarios could make your argument more persuasive and comprehensive.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style Issues:** While there are no significant spelling errors, some sentences could be clearer to enhance readability and impact. For example, consider revising complex sentences to be more straightforward.

Human activities are said to be one of the major causes and with a joined effort from governments and their people, measures can be taken to mitigate these problems. \\n Human being's constant demands for economic development and expansion by producing new products and goods have played a major part in the deterioration of the environment. To support these processes, natural resources are being unsustainably exploited at such a rapid rate that they cannot recover adequately. What is more, production at factories, together with exhaust gases from vehicles, produces a large amount of greenhouse gases and this causes serious air pollution. In addition, deforestation for farming lands and residential and industrial areas has reduced the earth's capability to absorb these poisonous gases. As a result, global warming and climate change have been pervasive over the world. \\n Having said that, it is not impossible to improve the current status of the environment. Firstly, households and manufacturing plants can substitute fossil fuels with renewable and green energy sources such as solar or wind energy. Furthermore, governments should promote the usage of environmental-friendly and recyclable raw materials in production processes. They can, additionally, reduce taxes for companies that contribute environmental conservation. Lastly, people should gradually switch to using electric devices such as cars and kitchen ware because these are less harmful to the environment. \\n To conclude, while it is clear that the environment is getting worse, there are certainly solutions that can be carried out to prevent further damage and make it better.","human_feedback_text":"The essay shows your potential to give targeted responses to the given question.

Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages. Give your opinion. \\n Many people are convinced that it is a waste of time to pay attention to the languages which are likely to be extinct. From my perspective, trying to preserve these languages have both advantages and disadvantages to a certain extent. \\n On the one hand, saving these languages has variable benefits at varying degrees. The most important reason is that protecting languages of ethnic minorities synonyms with maintaining the diversity of our culture, which is a national issue and the government should bear the responsibility. Languages have an extremely close connection to our traditions, religions, society and what we had obtained in the past. If these languages disappear, scientists will have difficulties in doing research about the life in the past, which means some valuable resources will be buried forever. \\n On the other hand, there are several reasons that prevent the government from investing money in conserving minority languages. It is reasonable that people assessed those as unnecessary languages because these languages are peculiar to a small amount of the ethnic minorities living in some isolated area. If these languages run the risk of extinction or even being disappeared, nothing will change in our social life since more popular languages have greater influences on the world like English. More importantly, a more substantial number of social issues deserve adequate funding from the government than less well-known languages. For instance, diseases are those which have a directly impact on the human and it will be unfair to pay for languages while ignoring human demands. \\n In conclusion, it is quite vital for every countries to cater money for protecting languages of ethnic minorities whereas the government should not spend money preserving all languages but investing in finding solutions for social issues.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, why are you focused on the government responsibility in preserving languages when the essay is asking you to discuss if you agree that having fewer languages in the world, not just in your country, will be more beneficial? You have narrowed down the focus of the discussion to be only within your country when you are being asked for an international point of view \/ opinion for the discussion. This is not and advantage\/disadvantage, nor an extent essay. This is a direct opinion essay that requires you to decide whether you agree that allowing international languages to become extinct will be more beneficial for the world. It is not about language preservation, it is about how the world will be easier to live in because people will, in the future, be speaking common languages instead. \\n Think of this essay in terms of the business world. The international business community has become smaller and easier to navigate for businessmen who study languages. The business languages are English, Spanish, French, and Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese, Fookien, etc.). As such, it has become easier for businessmen to travel the world and discuss with their counterparts. This is evidence that having fewer languages will benefit society in general. \\n This is the main reason why I believe that you did not appropriately discuss the prompt requirement. You focused on the wrong argument in the essay which means you did not totally understand what the prompt was asking you to do.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay addresses a critically important topic: the extinction of languages and whether global communication would benefit from having fewer languages. However, the focus seems to be misaligned with the question asked. The prompt invites an evaluation of the broader implications of language extinction on an international scale, particularly regarding the simplification of global communication. Instead, the essay explores the importance of preserving minority languages, primarily within the context of national responsibility and cultural heritage. This shift in focus means that the essay does not directly address whether having fewer languages worldwide would be more beneficial.\n\nFirstly, the essay successfully highlights the cultural and scientific value of preserving languages, pointing out the significance of linguistic diversity for cultural heritage and scientific research. This argument presents a clear viewpoint that saving languages has inherent value. However, by concentrating on the government's role in language preservation within individual countries, the essay shifts away from addressing the global perspective required by the prompt. A more balanced approach would consider the global benefits and drawbacks of reducing linguistic diversity, perhaps by discussing the ease of international business and cross-cultural communication that could result from fewer languages.\n\nRegarding spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, there are several points to consider:\n- The phrase \"trying to preserve these languages have both advantages and disadvantages\" should be corrected to \"has both advantages and disadvantages\" to agree in number with the subject.\n- The essay occasionally uses phrases that may confuse readers or detract from clarity, such as \"synonyms with maintaining.\" Instead, consider \"equivalent to maintaining\" for clearer expression.\n- Be cautious of phrases like \"variable benefits at varying degrees,\" which could be simplified for clarity and conciseness. \n\nThe essay's point of view appears divided. While it leans towards the importance of preserving linguistic diversity, it also briefly acknowledges the potential benefits of having fewer languages without fully exploring this perspective. To enhance clarity and persuasiveness, the essay should more directly state whether the advantages of having fewer languages globally outweigh the disadvantages, in line with the essay prompt.\n\nIn terms of argument support, the essay presents thorough reasoning for the value of linguistic diversity but lacks detailed examination of how fewer languages could benefit global communication and society at large. To strengthen this aspect, consider incorporating specific examples, such as the role of major languages in international business, as the feedback suggests. This would provide a more balanced view and directly address the essay prompt.\n\nIn conclusion, while the essay offers valuable insights into the importance of language preservation, it strays from the direct question of whether fewer languages would globally be more beneficial. Refocusing the essay to directly address the prompt, clarifying the author's stance, and providing balanced arguments with specific examples would significantly enhance the response. Simplifying language and correcting grammatical issues will also make the essay more effective and easier to understand."}

The topic is unique and not academic in nature so I am guessing that this is not for a college application. Or is it? Please correct me if I am wrong. You have written very good foundation sentences for your paragraphs. What you have to do is make the paragraphs better developed by further developing the ideas you presented. For example, when you talk of the need for hospitals in your country, tell the reader what kind of hospitals these will be. Will it be community hospitals subsidized in funding by your money and the government? Or will it be a charity medical center fully funded by your foundation? Speaking of foundations, you do know that billionaires spend their money by giving money to charity through their foundations right? So I think you should first establish that as a billionaire, you will first start a foundation for general needs in your country. That way you will be able to properly spend the money that you wish to donate to the causes and advocacy that mention in your essay. \\n Like I said, you have good topics for discussion. The problem that your essay faces is that you do not discuss how you will disseminate your funds and what the additional objectives of your foundation will be. As a billionaire, you cannot just write a check to give away your money, you still need to account for the expenses that the charities you support receive via the foundation.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay addresses an interesting topic regarding how to responsibly spend and invest a large sum of money, like that of a billionaire. The ideas presented touch on meaningful areas: investing in personal interests, supporting schools and hospitals, providing for the poor, improving working conditions, and enhancing opportunities for young people. These topics display a commendable level of social awareness and a good heart.\n\nHowever, to make the essay stronger and more compelling, it\u2019s important to focus on several areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:**\n   - The essay does communicate a general sense of what would be done with the wealth of a billionaire but lacks depth in how these actions would be executed. For example, instead of simply stating the desire to support schools and hospitals, elaborate on what type of support would be provided. Would this involve funding new buildings, providing scholarships, or something else?\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**\n   - There are numerous opportunities to improve the essay's grammar and style. For example, consider using the correct punctuation and contractions (e.g., \"I\u00b4m\" should be \"I'm\", and sentences need appropriate punctuation marks at the end). Aim for clearer sentence structures to enhance readability. Additionally, be mindful of sentence flow and coherence to ensure the essay reads smoothly.\n\n3. **Clarity of the Author's Viewpoint:**\n   - The point of view is somewhat clear but could be made more explicit by stating specific intentions and values driving these decisions. For example, when discussing generosity, specify why it's important and how it aligns with personal beliefs or values.\n\n4. **Descriptive Arguments:**\n   - While the essay suggests many philanthropic activities, it falls short of explaining how these would be realistically achieved. Introducing the idea of establishing a foundation could provide a structured means to channel funds into the various causes mentioned. Detailing the process, such as deciding how to assign funds, accountability measures for spending, and the foundation's broader objectives, would add depth and realism to the proposal.\n   - Additionally, offering more detailed descriptions of the planned investments and initiatives would strengthen the argument. Mention how ensuring good working conditions or providing courses could directly impact communities.\n\nTo enhance the essay:\n- Incorporate concrete examples or elaborate on proposed actions with more specific details.\n- Improve sentence structure and grammar for greater clarity and a more professional presentation.\n- Add coherence to the essay by connecting ideas smoothly from one paragraph to the next.\n\nRemember, a good essay not only presents ideas but also shows how those ideas are relevant, feasible, and meaningful. Focusing on these areas will undoubtedly create a more persuasive and impactful essay."}

Hence, in many families both parents decide to go out for work in order to earn more money. This trend has sparked a heated argument. While many people believe that the extra income resulting from that will be advantageous for these families' children, others concede that they are likely to have insufficient parental support. Both views will be clarified hereafter in this essay and I will propose my perspective as well. \\n It is comprehensible to say that additional earnings profit these children due to some reasons. \\n The most obvious excuse is that money plays a tremendous role in people's lives. Both parents take up working means that more money are made and they will be able to provide their children with advanced facilities and a better environment. In addition, having higher income also enable children in these family to acquire better education. In fact, a lot of prestigious schools which apply foreign curriculum and provide suitable environment to keep up students' talent often require high intuition fee. Take my village as an example, only one out of the people was able to obtain universities because of the fees required to afford university learnings such as accommodation fees, electric bills. \\n On the other hand, that both parents go out to work also causes a lack of parental assistance and possibly make children feel isolated. Initially, children in these families will have to learn to live and manage their doings independently since they were young. Additionally, these children are likely to be influenced by the inappropriate contents from TV or peer pressure due to the lack of parental orientation. Parents play an integral role in a child growth, they teach children to distinguish between wrong and right and bring up their moral conscience. Reports show that most perpetrators causing young crimes live in families in which both parents immerse themselves in work and have little time with their children. \\n In conclusion, the additional earnings made when parents both go out to work provide children many advantages of advanced environment and prestigious education However, the lack of parental orientation may also result in isolation and depravation in moral conscience.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, according to your prompt paraphrase, which correctly explained the original prompt, you are going to be clarifying the two public points of view and then propose your perspective regarding the discussion. Your prompt paraphrase is proper and correct. However, the discussion that you presented is incorrect. Right from the first reasoning paragraph, you already used a personal point of view. You never once referred this discussion as being from the first public point of view by indicating \"As per the first group's belief...\" which tells the reader whose point of view is being discussed. The second set should have said something like \"In opposition to that belief, there are people who argue that...\" to show that another public pov is referred to. Only after these two references could you have said \"After careful consideration, I believe that...\" to indicate your own point of view. The example about your village could have only been presented appropriately within your personal pov paragraph, not anywhere else within the essay. \\n You seem to have a fixation on using an apostrophe when referring to plural forms. That is incorrect. The plural form never requires an apostrophe. However, an apostrophe S is required when referring to ownership. So it is correct to say \"families\" but not \"families'\", \"students\" not \"students'\". Also, since only person went to college in your town, you should have said \"obtained a university degree\". One cannot \"obtain universities\" unless he is extremely rich because your phrase refers to a person buying universities instead of attending a university for higher studies. Be careful of your word presentations as it alters the meaning of a word or phrase.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"This essay attempts to discuss the implications of both parents working, focusing on the perceived benefits and disadvantages for their children. While the essay addresses the topic by outlining two different viewpoints before stating a personal perspective, there are areas where clarity and specificity could be greatly improved.\n\nFirst, it's important to clearly distinguish between public opinions and your own viewpoint throughout the essay. Currently, personal perspectives seem to be intertwined with general views from the beginning, creating some confusion. To make your essay more coherent, introduce each public point of view with a clear statement, such as \"According to one perspective...\" and \"On the contrary, some believe...\". After presenting these viewpoints thoroughly, you can then introduce your own opinion with a distinct transition, such as \"After considering both viewpoints, I personally believe...\". This structure will not only improve the flow of your essay but also ensure your personal perspective is appropriately positioned.\n\nRegarding language use, there's a recurring issue with forming plurals and possessives. Remember, plurals of nouns are typically formed by simply adding an 's' or 'es' without an apostrophe (for example, \"parents\"), whereas possessives usually require an apostrophe followed by 's' (for example, \"children's education\"). Also, be attentive to how you phrase your sentences to convey precise meanings; for instance, instead of saying someone \"was able to obtain universities,\" it's accurate to state \"was able to obtain a university degree.\"\n\nAdditionally, grammatical and stylistic errors slightly hinder the reader's understanding. These include misused words (e.g., \"excuse\" instead of \"reason,\" \"intuition fee\" instead of \"tuition fee\") and awkward phrasing (\"money are made\"). To better communicate your arguments, focus on using correct terminology and grammar. A thorough proofreading session can help identify and correct these issues.\n\nIn terms of arguments presented, ensure that examples and reasoning directly support the viewpoint under discussion. The example from your village is compelling but would serve your argument better if clearly linked to your personal perspective, illustrating why it informs your viewpoint rather than being presented as evidence for a general trend.\n\nIn summary, your essay presents an important discussion on the effects of dual-income families on children. To enhance your essay, focus on clear structure and distinction of viewpoints, correct grammar and word usage, and directly relevant examples.

Despite the opinions from some people suppose it is relatively appropriate, I personally disagree with that. The following essay will illustrate two principle reasons why my view is on the opposite. \\n One point which I consider to be absolutely vital is that school is like a lesser society which offers an environment for students to nurture their social interactive ability. Students, for instance, could learn how to cooperate together in order to complete reports efficiently. In addition, they could also learn how to cope with obstacles while confronting misconception. Therefore, if schools still decide to group students separately, students would definitely lose the opportunity to interact with different types of other students and to improve their interpersonal communicative competence. \\n Further and even more importantly, I am of the opinion that every student is distinguished and have different talents in various fields which may even not be opted as a school subject. Such as on one hand, some of the students may be fond of going outside and photographing rather than calculating geometry and algebra. On the other hand, some of the students might be noisy and unconcentrated during a biology class. Nonetheless, they could immerse themselves immediately into an incredible fascinating world of hip-pop music. Hence, separating students would only hurt them badly and could even deteriorate present circumstances. \\n In conclusion, I believe that every student is unique no matter how many A or F they can obtain in an exam. As a result, I personally do not agree with the idea that disruptive school students should be categorized specially and taught individually.","human_feedback_text":"You did not discuss the situation of disruptive students in class. You changed the prompt discussion totally. You only discussed students who have a different character from others. Which, as can be seen in your discussion, does not relate to disruptiveness in class. You have to remember that disruptive student can prevent his classmates from learning either in a group or classroom setting because he does not allow the lesson to be taught properly. As such, he prevents the other students from learning. Which is why the teachers would like to separate them from the rest of the class. \\n You probably know the disruptive student as the class clown. The one who always makes the class laugh or is always scolded by the teacher for not paying attention, or he is doing something opposite to what the rest of the class is doing. These are the disruptive actions that prove to be a negative influence on the others. He is a negative influence because he breaks the concentration and focus from the class lesson onto his antics instead. The class ends with the teacher just scolding the disruptive student, and the rest of the class was not taught the lesson for the day. \\n So your overall discussion is incorrect. It is not related to the given discussion topic. You have to learn to analyze the question before you start writing. When you make a mistake in understanding the keyword, in this case \"disruptive\", you will not be able to discuss the essay based on the expected information or standards. The point of the essay, is that the disruptive students do not learn in the manner that the rest of the class does, so they should be taught in a separate method or class. \\n It is true, school is a form of social environment. However, it is a learning social environment. Students do not go to school to be entertained, they go to school to learn, develop their skills, and nurture their natural abilities. A disruptive student prevents that learning environment from succeeding because he is there not to learn, but just to have fun. Your overall defense is improper. While there are no right or wrong answers, your response should at least show that you understand the main point of the discussion. In this case, you failed to understand what the discussion is all about. The only time a disruptive student would be welcome in the learning community would be during recess, lunch break, and after school during extra curricular activities. That is the only time when the learning method is informal and would allow him to be as disruptive as he wishes to be. That is the only social learning time the students have outside of formal class hours. \\n As of now, your essay is not worth scoring yet.

Unfortunately, your comprehension skills are not strong enough and your writing skills need to be further honed.

However, there are several areas where the essay can be significantly improved to align better with the prompt and provide a clearer, more compelling argument.\n\nFirst and foremost, the essay misses the core of the topic by not directly discussing the behaviors and impacts of disruptive students in a classroom setting. The focus seems to be more on the diversity of student talents and interests rather than on how disruptive behavior specifically affects the learning environment for all students. It's crucial to directly address the main concern: how disruptive behaviors (like constantly interrupting the class, not paying attention, etc.) prevent not only the disruptor's learning but also their classmates' learning.\n\nTo improve, the essay should clearly define what it means by \"disruptive students\" and discuss specific ways in which such students affect the learning environment. Incorporating examples of disruptive behavior and its direct consequences on the class would make the argument more grounded and responsive to the prompt.\n\nSecondly, although the essay suggests an inclusive view towards all students regardless of their academic performance, it doesn't substantiate how this inclusiveness can be maintained without compromising the learning experience for others. The argument would benefit from exploring strategies or methods that balance the need for an inclusive classroom with the need for an uninterrupted, focused learning environment for all students.\n\nConcerning language use, the essay is generally well-written but has room for improvement in terms of clarity and precision. Sentences like \"Despite the opinions from some people suppose it is relatively appropriate,\" could be simplified for better comprehension. Consider rephrasing for clearer expression, such as \"Although some people believe it is appropriate...\"\n\nMoreover, there are instances of awkward phrasing and punctuation errors that can disrupt the flow of reading. For example, \"Such as on one hand, some of the students may be fond of going outside and photographing rather than calculating geometry and algebra.\" This could be more clearly expressed as, \"For example, some students may prefer outdoor photography to solving problems in geometry and algebra.\"\n\nFinally, the essay would benefit from a more structured approach to argumentation. Each paragraph should focus on a specific aspect of the debate, providing clear reasons and examples to support the author's stance. Using synonyms for key terms, as suggested, could also help in diversifying the language and making the argument more engaging while still staying on topic.\n\nIn summary, to strengthen the essay, it's recommended to:\n1. Directly address the issue of disruptiveness in schools and its impact on learning.\n2. Elaborate on ways to handle disruptive behavior that respects the diversity of all students.\n3. Clarify and simplify language use for greater accessibility.\n4. Organize the essay with focused paragraphs, each supporting a single point with reasons and examples.\n\nImproving these areas will not only make the essay more relevant to the prompt but also enhance its overall clarity, coherence, and persuasiveness."}

I suppose that this has both demerits and merits. \\n On one hand, it's no secret that exercising is good for us both mentally and physically. When we do sports, our body will create certain kinds of hormones which can help our mind to relax; therefore, it can be a terrific way to relieve stress and refresh our mind after a nerve-racking day of work. I believe that a tired and stressed employee could not make rational decisions or work effectively. Moreover, sedentary employees might have a higher chance to face gradual health deterioration; thus, it is necessary for them to exercise on a regular basis. A wide range of diseases are also prevented if we burn some calories through working out. In so doing, not only one could tone the body but also decline the risk of obesity. \\n On the other hand, going to gyms and sports clubs might cost one a tremendous amount of time. The benefits that can gain through exercising are not overnight; hence, one has to be patient and persistent to derive them. In addition, these vigorous activities require a lot of energy. This could result in sore muscles and fatigue which might be a hindrance for employees to work properly. \\n In conclusion, working out has both advantages and disadvantages. Exercising is undisputedly good for our health, but too much of anything is bad, one should know how to do it wisely.","human_feedback_text":"The first sentence is an incorrect prompt restatement.

Rather than providing a clear comparison per business sector opinions, you are using a general personal reference point. The public comparison target based on 3 points of comparison ( pro, con, personal) disappeared.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"This essay attempts to evaluate the importance of gym and sports club activities in enhancing employees' health and productivity, recognizing the existence of both advantages and disadvantages. However, there are several areas that could be improved to make your argument more compelling and aligned with the essay topic's requirements.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** It appears that the introduction does not accurately restate the topic as it was given. The essay is meant to discuss perspectives based on different roles (such as business owners) regarding the impact of physical activities on employees, but it incorrectly frames the topic without specifying these viewpoints. An improved introduction would clearly separate and introduce the different perspectives required by the topic, especially focusing on the business-related viewpoint rather than a general one.\n\n2. **Clarity and Precision in Language:** There are moments in the essay where simplifying the language could improve clarity. Use direct and simple terms that accurately convey your points, rather than complex phrases that might confuse readers. For instance, instead of saying \"a tremendous amount of time,\" you might say \"a lot of time\" to keep the language straightforward and clear.\n\n3. **Third Person Perspective:** The essay tends to use a general, personal point of view, which diverges from the requirement to present arguments from a third-person business owner's perspective. It's crucial to maintain the designated point of view across the essay to fulfill the topic's needs. Try to frame your arguments as if you're analyzing the situation from an employer's or business owner's perspective, focusing on how gym and sports club activities affect employees' productivity and health from that viewpoint.\n\n4. **Comparison and Arguments:** While the essay mentions some advantages and disadvantages of physical activity for employees, it misses a structured comparison among different business sectors or specific roles. To enhance your essay, consider structuring it around clear points of comparison\u2014such as impact on productivity, health, and personal well-being\u2014analyzed from the perspective of different stakeholders in a business environment. This approach will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\n5. **Grammar and Style:** Watch out for minor spelling, grammar, and style issues. Although the essay is mostly clear, ensuring correct use of verb tenses, punctuation, and sentence structure can improve readability and effectiveness. For example, carefully reviewing the essay to correct instances of awkward phrasing or overly complex sentence structures can make your arguments more accessible to the reader.\n\n6. **Clear Position:** Lastly, while it's important to address both the pros and cons of the topic, make sure to clearly state your own stance or conclusion, based on the evidence presented. Your conclusion does this to some extent but refining it to more directly state the balance or preference you suggest could strengthen your argument.\n\nBy addressing these points, the essay could be significantly improved in terms of clarity, adherence to the topic, and the effectiveness of its arguments."}

Personally, I completely support this viewpoint. \\n First, the ability to determine an issue is right or wrong is crucial for kids because it is one of the elements that make their personality. Once the personality is generated, it will be stable and hard to adjust. Therefore, helping the to distinguish between good and bad behaviors is essential. Furthermore, punishment is helpful in case that children behave badly due to the guilty feeling it provides. Unless they are able to self-correct their way of thinking, stricter punishments should be applied. \\n In contrast, there are a lot of disagreements to this viewpoint. Most of the young adults think that children are still very young and punishments are unnecessary. To my mind, I believe that early age is the suitable period of time for a person to learn about morality, additionally, it is easier to train small children than teenagers and young adults. In the other hand, many people argue that a child will grow up eventually and he can learn themselves. As cited above, a person's character is stable once generated, and those children who are not trained about morality will be hard to fit in any community due to their lack of consciousness. \\n Many kinds of punishments can be used by parents and teachers to teach young children. Among them, the best way that I can think of is that we should make them stay in their own room, let them think about what they did and decide if it is good or bad. Any violent punishment such as hitting by a stick or not allowing them to eat should not be applied because the merely influence badly on them \\n In conclusion, I strongly agree with the viewpoint that the distinction between right and wrong should be taught to children and punishment can be made if necessary.","human_feedback_text":"Mai, there are 4 elements that need to be represented in your opening statement.

There is a strong belief that the lessons need to be reinforced with a punishment in order to help the children remember what they did wrong. In this essay, I will be discussing my opinion of the topic and what sort of punishment I believe is necessary to prevent the child from making the same mistake in the future.<\/em> \\n It is important that you pay attention to fully developing your opening statement because this is the first scoring element of the essay. If you increase your score to the maximum in the task accuracy portion, you will be able to gain better consideration for any shortcomings that you may have in the other paragraphs. If you can prove that you understand the requirements of the essay, then the rest of the elements should be scored considerably better than if you had a low TA score. \\n Do not indicate your position on the issue within the opening paragraph. Stating your position requires you to present a discussion explaining that stand. Which is why it is always advised that you place that opinion in a separate paragraph within the essay. The opinion paragraph is your chance to prove that you have the GRA to express yourself in English and also, be understood by others. Stating your position in the opening statement defeats that purpose. \\n Always leave some time during the practice test to review and edit your essay.

Investing time in proofreading and editing the essay would significantly enhance its readability and effectiveness. Paying close attention to grammar and punctuation is essential for improving the essay's clarity and professionalism.\n\nRegarding the author's point of view, it is clear throughout the essay. However, the presentation could be improved by not stating the personal position in the opening paragraph but rather developing it in a separate paragraph. This approach allows for a more nuanced discussion and gives you an opportunity to effectively express your reasoning and grasp of the English language.\n\nFurthermore, while the essay presents arguments in favor of teaching children right from wrong and employing punishment, the arguments could be more descriptive and detailed. Providing concrete examples, elaborating on why specific types of punishment are preferred, and explaining how these contribute to a child's understanding of morality would make the argument stronger and more persuasive.\n\nLastly, the conclusion, although effective in summarizing the essay's stance, could be expanded into at least three sentences.

Others think it is bad.","essay_text":"International sports events such as World cup or Olympics attract millions of visitors both inside and outside the host country. Although holding events of such a large scale may do harm to the country, I would argue that it does bring some significant benefits. \\n Apparently, there are some drawbacks that should be taken into careful consideration when holding an international sports event. First of all, such events may lead to a higher level of pollution. More people coming means more vehicles used and more exhausted fumes emitted. For those reasons, pollution, such as noise and air pollution, gets worse afterwards and severely affects the health of the natives. Another the downside is the coronavirus, a contagious virus. In an era where COVID-19 is rampaging, it is likely that the virus will spread all over the country and kill millions of people if the government doesn't strictly comply distancing and sanitary regulations. Last but not least, there may be threat of terrorism and damage to traditional buildings or cultural heritages due to the carelessness and irresponsibility of visitors. \\n I advocate celebrating sports events on international scale for the reason that it will be profitable to the host country. During the events, the country can make millions of dollars from many sources such as selling admission tickets or signing ads contracts with famous sports gear brands. Moreover, a lump sum of money can also be made through the traveling of visitors. The events are also great opportunity to promote tourism. Many visitors will spend a few days paying a visit to well-known tourist attractions. What's more, the country should make good use of the occasions to make its good sides such as hospitality, scenic views and so on known to the public. \\n In short, such huge events when held definitely have some difficulties. However, in my opinion, if the country can deal with the problems effectively, international sports events may help boost the economy of the host country remarkably. \\n Sometimes, I have difficulty expressing my ideas in a sentence with proper length. Do you have any advice?","human_feedback_text":"Any writer who does not use a discussion outline prior to drafting his response essay will find himself writing an uneven paragraph presentation. The writer needs to consider the discussion topic in relation to the discussion question or instruction from the original prompt. \\n Divide the presentation into paragraphs.

Follow that sentence with the reasoning sentence, example sentence, additional reasons, then a transition sentence into the next topic ( for hohesive purposes). Accomplish those basic writing expectations per paragraph and the presentation will be well balanced. Make sure though that there is an understanding of the prompt based on the writing instructions. Provide the discussions accordingly. \\n Aim to write the maximum number of sentences as suggested for maximum scoring consideration.

By writing these number of sentences, the paragraph presentations will always be of proper, and of maximum scoring length.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay on the impact of international sports events like the World Cup or Olympics on the host country presents a clear position, making a case for the benefits despite acknowledging potential drawbacks. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance the clarity, structure, and depth of the argument presented.\n\nFirst, addressing the essay's response to the topic, the approach is commendable for covering both positive and negative aspects of hosting international sports events. However, it can benefit from a more structured discussion outline. Each paragraph should ideally begin with a topic sentence that clearly states what the paragraph will discuss. This should be followed by sentences providing reasoning, examples, further explanation, and finally, a transition sentence to smoothly lead into the next paragraph. This structure will not only make the argument more coherent but also ensure that each paragraph contributes effectively to the overall thesis.\n\nOn the matter of spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues, the essay is generally well-written but could be improved by careful proofreading to catch and correct minor errors. Phrases like \"Another the downside is the coronavirus,\" could be revised for clarity and correctness to \"Another downside is the coronavirus.\"\n\nThe essay author's point of view is clearly expressed, advocating for the economic and promotional benefits of hosting such events. However, to strengthen this viewpoint, it would be beneficial to include more specific examples and data to back up claims. Additionally, exploring a deeper analysis of how these benefits weigh against the drawbacks mentioned would provide a more nuanced argument.\n\nRegarding the supporting arguments, while they do indicate the potential economic and publicity gains for the host country, they would benefit from further development. For instance, discussing how the revenue generated from these events compares to the investment required or how the promotion of tourism could have long-term benefits for the country's economy and international reputation.\n\nThe concern about expressing ideas in sentences of proper length is understandable. A useful strategy is to aim for paragraph structures that balance brevity and detail. As a rule of thumb, each paragraph should contain no less than three sentences and no more than five. This ensures each paragraph is long enough to develop an idea thoroughly but not so long that it overwhelms the reader or disrupts the essay's flow.\n\nIn conclusion, while the essay effectively presents a position on the hosting of international sports events, implementing a more structured approach to paragraph construction, along with deeper analysis and more specific examples, will significantly enhance the argument's clarity and persuasiveness.

Firstly, journeys to isolated regions are referred as remedies for unquenchable curiosity of human being. Discovering pristine lands empower travellers to push out the horizon of their knowledge and enjoying unforgettable memories with Mother of Nature. Secondly, this kind of tourism is also beneficial from a economic perspective. Being aimed at high-spending visitors, the so-called upper-crust services contribute considerably to the revenue of tourism firms and native countries, as well as creating millions of jobs worldwide. Thirdly, those journeys grant man the opportunities for a sustainable future.

Furthermore, overexploitation and tourism can result in the demise of traditional customs and heritages of native tribes for the sake of adaption to tourists' lifestyle.

In my opinion, there are certain factors which have contributed to this situation, as well as significant consequences for society as a whole. \\n A main cause of disrespect towards seniors is that they are incapable of coping with the rapid changes which occur throughout the world. In other words, older people think in a more conservative way than the youth and unable to understand the meaning of progress and modernisation. For instance, the elderly have trouble handling technological devices, such as computers and mobile phones, as they have not been taught how to do so. Consequently, young people have neither the patience nor the willingness to introduce them to their own value system, thus older people are not respected enough. \\n For this reason, a major effect would be the isolation and marginalisation of the elderly. Namely, in spite of the fact that they are typically members of this society, they do not get the chance to provide the rest of its members with precious knowledge and advice. For example, older people are considered outdated by the youth for highly valuing the simple things in life, such as food, and they do not try to find the meaning behind their words. Therefore, seniors end up in nursing homes, as they cannot be taken care of, demonstrating that the older ones do not fit in a modern society. \\n In conclusion, older people are disrespected due to lack of understanding by the younger ones, for they act based on different values, resulting in the elderly being on the sidelines.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, one of the requirements that we have here is that the student has to post the complete prompt requirement that you are responding to. We use that original prompt and instructions to examine the work that you have done and the problem areas that your writing might have. Since you did not provide a copy of the instructions, the review of your essay will only be based on general observations rather than exam specific considerations. Kindly remember to post the prompt along with your second essay for review. Don't bother with posting the prompt now. You only get one free assessment per thread. I won't be able to give you a second assessment even if you post it after this review. Here is my general observation of your essay. \\n The opening paraphrase is incomplete. The TA portion of the test will only give you a high score for the prompt restatement and completely developed paragraph presentation. You only have 2 sentences when the minimum requirement is 3. I do not get a sense of the complete prompt topic for discussion nor the original discussion instruction. The outline for discussion is therefore incomplete. \\n Your paragraphs must only focus on 1 topic at the most, per presentation. You need a topic sentence and a supporting declaration. These can be completed in 5 sentences and will represent a thoroughly developed discussion. The first sentence will be the topic sentence and then the last 3-4 sentences will be the supporting sentences. At the moment, you are stating \"facts\" without truly explaining why these should be considered truthful in nature. Are these popular reasons or personal reasons? There needs to be a recognition of where your evidence is coming from and why that makes it a factual line of reasoning. \\n Try to develop a better conclusion. an effective conclusion should also be comprised of 3-5 sentences that repeats the original topic, the discussion instructions, the facts you provided, and your personal opinion (if required). I will admit that this is a good effort as a first time writer on your part. However, the lack of instructions and my inability to analyze your essay due to the missing instructions and topic statement make me wonder if this type of response would get a passing score in an actual setting. I need the original prompt requirement in order to assess that so make sure that you don't forget to give it to me the next time you post an essay for review.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay directly addresses a significant social issue, which is the lack of respect toward the elderly in many societies. This indicates an understanding of a topic that requires analysis and discussion. Yet, to guide improvements, several observations need to be shared.\n\nFirstly, the structure of the introduction did not fully meet the expected standards. An effective introduction should contain at least three sentences: one to paraphrase the prompt, another to state the main ideas, and a third to outline the structure of the essay. This setup helps readers understand the topic and what the essay will cover. The provided introduction, although starting strong, could benefit from a clearer outline of the main points to be discussed, thereby setting a more solid foundation for the essay.\n\nRegarding the body paragraphs, the focus should remain on one key idea per paragraph. Each paragraph ideally starts with a topic sentence that introduces this idea, followed by several sentences that explain, support, or elaborate on this idea. It is advisable to avoid stating assertions as facts without backing them up with evidence or explanations. Highlighting whether these are widely accepted views or personal observations can add credibility to the argument.\n\nThe conclusion of the essay, while encapsulating the main points, could be made more effective by enhancing its structure. A well-crafted conclusion should revisit the original topic, briefly summarize the key arguments made within the essay, and, if applicable, include a concluding thought or a reflection that leaves an impression on the reader. This not only rounds off the essay but also reinforces your viewpoint.\n\nIn terms of content, the essay succeeds in presenting a clear stance on the issue. It argues that a lack of understanding and the fast pace of change contribute to the marginalization of the elderly. However, the argument would be strengthened by distinguishing between widely accepted reasons and personal perceptions. Detailing the source of these perceptions would enrich the discussion and lend more authority to the claims.\n\nStyle and grammar are also important. The essay is mostly well-written, but attention to sentence structure and variety can enhance readability and engagement. Varied sentence lengths and structures can make the writing more dynamic and interesting to read.\n\nOverall, the essay is a commendable effort, particularly in choosing and discussing a relevant and complex issue. With focused improvements on structure, clarity, and support for assertions, the essay has the potential to engage more deeply with the topic and leave a lasting impact on its readers. Remember, every piece of writing is a step toward becoming a more effective communicator, and each revision is an opportunity to sharpen your skills."}

Ostensibly, climate change is now the most telling sign of this trauma, to which there are mixed opinions amongst the public. Many would agree to fight against the catastrophe while others are trying to live with it. In this essay, the two ideas above will be analyzed in detail first, before some suggestions could be stated. \\n Countless concerted efforts have been made to prevent climate change since the day people became aware of it, and absolutely they have grounds for their acts. Climate change is the leading cause behind environmental degradation and devastation, such as global warming, fresh water scarcity, or wildlife extinction, to name but a few. Large-scale campaigns have been staged and launched in the hope that they could help tackle these issues and contain the spread of their severe affects. The ultimate goal of our strivings is not only to protect our lives but also sustain the living resources for the future generations, for they deserve this nurturing and awe-inspiring planet the same as we do. \\n However, it is not always worth the fight, so many others believe. If climate change is feasible to halt, it would have been done any time sooner than now. Co-existing with it therefore comes a solution for several reasons. First, not every government, especially developing countries, can afford to invest in preventive systems which are purpose-built for environmental protection mainly because there are a whole lot pressing things to do like feeding and dressing for its citizens. Besides, the changeable climate is perfect time for another plan to be accomplished: the clean-tech era deluged with all kinds of energy which are harnessed cleanly and unaffected to the environment. \\n In summary, we cannot blame anyone than ourselves for having caused climate change, it is thus our mutual responsibilities that we must shoulder in order to live in harmony yet try to keep the scenario under firm control as much to our abilities as possible.","human_feedback_text":"The first paragraph is used to restate the original topic ideas without variations.

However, there are several areas where improvements could significantly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the argument.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic**: The introductory statement introduces a personal insight that diverges from the main topic. While creativity is encouraged, it is crucial to closely adhere to the essay prompt to fully address the required elements. Staying focused on the prompt ensures that the essay is relevant and on topic. Consider revisiting the original prompt and ensuring that each paragraph contributes directly to answering it.\n\n2. **Clarity and Structure**: The essay would benefit from clearer distinctions between the differing viewpoints on climate change. It mentions two perspectives but does not thoroughly explore the basis behind each viewpoint. Ensuring each paragraph has a clear main idea related to the topic will help improve the focus and depth of analysis. It might also be helpful to explicitly state your personal stance on the issue to offer a more persuasive argument.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are minimal spelling and grammatical errors present. However, the essay sometimes uses complex and lengthy sentences, which may confuse readers. Simplifying sentences, while still using varied vocabulary and sentence structures, can enhance readability. Additionally, pay attention to the use of phrases that may be confusing or unclear, such as \"severe affects\" which should be \"severe effects.\"\n\n4. **Descriptive Arguments**: While the essay attempts to discuss the impact of climate change and societal responses, it lacks specific examples and detailed analysis to support its points. For instance, mentioning specific large-scale campaigns or detailing how developing countries might adopt clean-tech solutions could strengthen your arguments. Incorporating clear, real-world examples can make your position more compelling and persuasive.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Personal Opinion**: The conclusion summarizes the mutual responsibility to address climate change but could be strengthened by clearly stating your viewpoint. Reflecting on the essay, consider explicitly articulating a personal stance on whether fighting climate change or adapting to it is the more viable approach. This personal reflection can offer readers a distinct perspective and make your conclusion more impactful.\n\nIn essence, focusing on closely adhering to the essay prompt, clarifying your arguments with specific examples, simplifying language for readability, and elaborating on personal opinion can significantly enhance the essay. By addressing these points, your essay can offer a well-rounded and persuasive analysis of the topic."}

However, I consider that children should grow up in a nurturing environment that allows them to develop their sense of self. \\n Children have numerous influences from the media, their schools, and friends but the household's guideline has the most crucial impact on their growth. They might start to be dependent on this advice if they constantly get told of what to do, how to behave, what is right and wrong. Instead, those take a step back to let their sons and daughters have their own time to handle the situation under parents' moderate supervision, treat them like a friend, not a parent. \\n Providing a safe and supportive environment for children at an early age is recommended by experts. Instead of making your \"little you\" say yes to your advice, we only need to be responsible adults and act as role models for the kids to reflect on. Their creative mind and self-identity will be formed over the years and they will be a helpful kid who treats others with respect and compassion than only be advice-givers.

The introduction should clearly restate the topic before presenting your personal stance. It appears your interpretation deviates slightly from the original topic provided, adding personal insights that were not part of the initial prompt. This approach shifts the focus and could confuse readers about the essay's core message. Aim to stick closely to the original topic, ensuring your personal opinions directly relate to it and are clearly articulated within that framework.\n\nYour essay also lacks a specific \"extent\" response expected in essays that request your agreement or disagreement with a given statement. Instead of a nuanced stance that specifies the degree to which you support or oppose the prompt, your current response seems more generalized. A more focused approach, stating explicitly to what extent you agree or disagree, would meet the essay requirements more effectively.\n\nRegarding content and structure, spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues slightly impede the readability of your essay. For example, the first sentence could be improved for a stronger impact: \"Proper parenting plays a crucial role in raising children, including offering them advice.\" Pay careful attention to capitalization and punctuation, as these small details significantly affect the professionalism of your writing.\n\nThe point of view in your essay is clear, focusing on the value of allowing children autonomy while still under parental guidance.

This structure helps guide the reader through your thought process and makes your stance more persuasive.\n\nLastly, creating a nurturing environment for children to develop their identities is rightly emphasized, but balancing advice with autonomy can be further explored. Consider discussing how parents can offer advice in a way that encourages children's independence and decision-making skills.\n\nIn summary, ensure your essay directly addresses and sticks to the topic provided, refine your extent response, and revise for any grammatical or stylistic issues.

For an effective essay, it is crucial to commit to a clear and consistent perspective throughout. When the task requires emphasizing one's opinion, diverging views should be used cautiously and only to strengthen the original argument, not to present an opposing argument as equally valid. \n\nHere's a breakdown of areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Clarity of Opinion:** The essay begins by suggesting a focus on the main major but later argues for the benefits of studying a broad range of subjects. This shift may confuse readers about the essay's main argument. Future essays should maintain a consistent stance that reflects the thesis statement throughout the text, thereby eliminating any potential confusion about the author's viewpoint.\n\n2. **Argument Development:** While the essay attempts to discuss both sides of the argument, it misses the opportunity to deeply explore and support the chosen stance. For each claim made, there should be direct evidence or examples provided to strengthen the argument. Focus on developing your key points with clear and relevant support to convey your reasoning effectively.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Overall, the essay is well-written but could benefit from careful proofreading to avoid minor errors and improve sentence structure. Aim for clear and concise sentences that directly support your main argument. Consider varying sentence length and structure to create a more engaging and dynamic essay.\n\n4. **Use of Examples:** The essay uses examples to support its points, which is good practice. However, make sure every example directly reinforces your thesis. Additionally, align examples more closely with your argument for a more persuasive essay.\n\nTo improve, consider the following strategies:\n- Decide on your position regarding the essay topic before writing and stick to it throughout the essay.\n- Develop your main points by providing solid evidence and examples that directly support your opinion.\n- Improve the clarity and impact of your writing through careful revision, focusing on spelling, grammar, and stylistic choices.\n- Use examples more effectively by ensuring they clearly support your argument and provide convincing evidence for your claims.\n\nRemember, the goal is to clearly convey your opinion and persuade readers through well-supported arguments.

It all stems from the way that you developed the essay and the grammar problems that you have in the sentences that you developed. \\n For starters, pay attention to the prompt requirements that you were given. You know what you are supposed to do with the prompts provided right? The expectation is that you will deliver a paraphrased version of these discussions and instructions within your opening statement. Instead of doing that, you immediately launched into a discussion of the topic instead. You began offering information and lengthy considerations in the opening statement rather than just presenting the required elements. The required elements are a paraphrased prompt, the paraphrased discussion instructions, and an indication of how these elements are to be discussed in the essay. \\n You need to work on your sentence structure and development. In the opening statement, the correct presentation would have been \"plethora OF numbers\". Practice using connector words in order to create a logical statement. I know that you did your best to develop complex sentences. However, you did not successfully progress beyond the problematic basic sentences because of the missing connector words and the improper use of terms (idleness persons should have been \"idle persons\"). \\n Finally, the concluding statement should never have additional information, specially in the notable number that you presented in your conclusion. It is impossible to develop a proper explanation for new ideas at that point, which is why it is advised that the writer not do that in the concluding statement. Rather, a quick wrap up of the discussion is preferred.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay addresses an important issue of crime and its relationship to poverty and unemployment, providing solutions to reduce crime rates. However, there are certain areas that require improvement to enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall quality of your work.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** It's crucial your essay starts by directly addressing the given topic. A good introduction should paraphrase the prompt and outline your response clearly, making it evident what stance you are taking and what the essay will discuss. Currently, your introduction jumps into the topic discussion without setting up a clear framework for the reader.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are several grammatical errors and instances of awkward phrasing that hinder the readability of your essay. For example, \u201cplethora numbers of criminal\u201d should be corrected to \u201ca plethora of criminal offenses.\u201d Pay careful attention to article usage (a\/an\/the) and proper prepositions. Furthermore, \"idleness persons\" is incorrect; the right expression is \"idle persons.\" Another area to work on is sentence structure; using connector words can help create more complex and logical sentences, contributing to a smoother flow of ideas.\n\n3. **Point of View Clarity:** Your point of view on the causes of crime and potential solutions is clear. It would be beneficial to further strengthen your argument by consistently using evidence or examples to support your views. When introducing new claims, make sure to back them up with either statistical data, examples, or well-reasoned logic.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** While you\u2019ve outlined several arguments linking crime to poverty and unemployment and proposed government intervention as a solution, these points need to be fleshed out more convincingly.

As nowadays we can easily watch movies on our electronic device at home, I personally believe that there is no need to travel to cinema to watching movies. \\n It is understandable why some people think it is essential to go to a movie theater. The main reason is that movie theaters offer great sound effect and big screen which you hardly accessed to in our home. With high quality of sound and screen, you can easily immersed in the vibe of the film. For example, when you watching action movie like Kung Fu, those high technology machines and sound systems around you makes you feel like you are in the movie and makes you feel more thrilling. Moreover, the latest movies only released in cinema, if you want to watch the same movie at home, you might need to wait like over two months after it out of theaters. \\n Despite the arguments mentioned above, I believe that there are more enjoyable if you watch movies at home. Firstly, you have more options when you look up films online. If you have a membership of Netflix, you can easily watch any genre of movies as you like while movie theaters only offer limited options. Secondly, home is always more private and cleaner than public space. With where you used to, you can be more relax and less distractions when you enjoy films. Finally, the choice of not go to the cinema will be a money saver, which means you feel less pressure with this entertainment. \\n In conclusion, although some people opine that it is essential to go to a movie theater because they can enjoy the newest movie with better services, I believe that it is no necessary to travel to cinema and pay for watching.

What can be done to solve this problem? \\n There are a number of factors that explain why the growth in producing consumer products harms the natural environment. However, this issue can be resolved by adopting a number of solutions, as will now be discussed. \\n It is true that the natural ecosystem gets worse as the harmful impacts of industrial activities. To begin with, the expansion of manufacturing demands more land to build the factories. This may require destroying the green spaces to make room for the factories which negatively affect the quality of atmosphere. Secondly, As more goods are produced, more toxic materials and gasses are burned and released to the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide and methane. Because the gasses are able to absorb radiation from the sun, they have a direct impact on the temperature of the planet. The global warming consequences result in rising sea levels, an increase in tsunamis, typhoons, which damage property and life of many people in the world. In addition, factories is the major contributing factor of water and air pollution as the increase in production produces more waste to the planet. If they are not recycled, these products can remain as waste for thousands of years, posing a threat to the living habitats of all creatures \\n Actions must be taken to minimize the devastating impacts on the natural environment from increasing the production of consumer goods. Firstly, companies should allocate funds for investing in solar energy systems, which help reduce the amount of fuel and electricity consumption, then decrease toxic emissions, which can improve global warming issues.

However, it leans more towards explaining the problem rather than concentrating on solving it. Given the topic's focus on solutions, there should be a stronger emphasis on detailed, practical solutions and less on describing the problem. \n\n2. **Originality and Vocabulary**: The introduction closely mimics the original prompt without enough originality.

Some explanations for this phenomenon will be put forward before certain appropriate ways of dealing with it are suggested. \\n The negative perception of indigenous people towards tourism could be ascribed to a number of reasons. A major cause is that the huge influx of foreign travelers is often associated with environmental issues. It is common to observe visitors throwing wrappers, cigarette butts and other rubbish in public areas without considering the permanent consequences of their actions. In addition, air contamination is inevitable, which stems from the growing demand for transport between tourist sites. Another contributor to the negative attitude of dwellers is the likelihood of spreading infectious diseases into the society. For example, in Thailand, recently, a couple traveling from Belgium is responsible for a large- scale community transmission of Covid-19, with positive cases increasing beyond the control of the government. \\n Several solutions could be taken to cope with the situation described above. The most practical measure is to elaborate that international tourism would bring about enormous advantages for native people, therefore offsetting its remaining drawbacks. For instance, the authorities may levy taxation schemes on tourism- related services, and then spend this tax on public amenities or building a better welfare state. Another legal remedy is that there should be heavy restrictions imposed on those who pay their visit abroad. To illustrate, holidaymakers will be required to be fully vaccinated and carry out medical checks before commencing their adventure in the host country. \\n In conclusion, international tourism receives criticism owing to its irreversible damage to the environment and residents' concern over widespread epidemics. This phenomenon can be addressed by making the locals directly benefit from global tourism and implementing stringent regulations on the entry of foreigners. \\n P\/s: I'd be very grateful if you guys could give me a band score for my essay. My teacher in class just gives us feedback on mistakes but not grading my assignment.","human_feedback_text":"The reason your teacher only gives feedback and not a grade or score for your writing is simple. The teacher does not want to mislead you into thinking that you are at a writing level of a particular band score when the examiner may assess you differently during the actual test. The best we can do as consultants is offer you potential scoring results based on the indivual sections. The idea is to present you with the clear reasons why you should focus on specific areas of development in your writing. Not to give you an idea of how you might score during the actual test. \\n The first problem with this essay is the word count. You must never write more than 300 words for the Task 2 essay because of the 40 minute writing limitation. Since you have to make sure that you have time to review, correct, and perfect the explanation you are presenting, you must never write more than this number of words. Additionally, longer essays tend to create forced errors on the part of the student. You will make more GRA, LR, and C&C errors because of the mistaken belief that longer essays will score better. It actually has the opposite effect. Longer essays could force a failing score that could have been avoided with a shorter piece. \\n The next reason that this essay is in error is because of the missing thesis statement. Notice the direct questions being asked in the prompt? These are meant to direct the clear writing of your essay by forcing you to summarize a response to each question. Thereby creating topic sentences and writing guides for the 2 reasoning paragraphs. The essay actually does not meet the writing requirements in the TA section because of these missing responses. You also changed the topic from \"bad thing for their country\" to \"disadvantages\" which is an incorrect discussion basis. The wrong keyword synonym was used, causing a lowering of the LR score. \\n There are even more problems with this essay that could be pointed out but I need to shorten my review at this point.

However, there are several key areas for improvement to enhance your writing and effectively address the essay topic. Here are detailed points to help guide your revision:\n\n1. **Essay Response to Topic:**\n   - Your essay addresses the topic of global tourism's drawbacks and proposes solutions. However, it lacks a clear thesis statement directly responding to the prompt's questions. To improve, ensure your introduction includes a thesis statement that summarizes your main arguments, addressing the specific questions or statements from the essay prompt. This will provide a clearer guide for your essay and help maintain focus on the topic.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:**\n   - Generally, your grammar and spelling are adequate, but there's room for refinement in sentence structure and word choice to enhance clarity and readability. Avoid overly complex sentences, and ensure your word selection accurately conveys your intended meaning. For example, instead of \"disparate parts of the world,\" a clearer phrase like \"different parts of the world\" might be more accessible.\n\n3. **Author's Point of View:**\n   - Your point of view is present but could be made stronger with a more assertive thesis statement and clearer argumentation in the body paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that clearly states its main idea, directly supporting your overall position. This structure will make your viewpoint more evident and persuasive.\n\n4. **Arguments Supporting the Point of View:**\n   - Your essay offers examples and reasons supporting your view, which is good. To further strengthen your argument, provide more specific examples and tie them back to your main point more explicitly. This could involve citing more concrete statistics or studies and elaborating on how the proposed solutions can directly mitigate the identified problems.\n\n5. **Essay Length and Structure:**\n   - Be mindful of your essay's length. Aim to write concisely to stay within the recommended word count, ensuring you have time to review and refine your work. Longer essays do not necessarily score higher and may lead to unnecessary errors. Focus on developing a few strong points rather than including many that are less thoroughly explained.\n\n6. **Adherence to Prompt Keywords:**\n   - Be careful with your choice of words and ensure they align with the essay prompt. For instance, switching \"bad thing for their country\" to \"disadvantages\" might subtly shift the essay's focus, affecting its relevance to the prompt. Precision in your language will help you stay on topic and meet the task's requirements.\n\nImproving in these areas will make your essay more coherent, persuasive, and aligned with the testing criteria. Keep practicing, and remember to structure your essays with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that directly support your thesis, and a coherent conclusion that sums up your arguments."}

Aim for consistency in your descriptions to keep your argument clear.\n\n3. **Clarity of Author\u2019s Point of View**: Your point of view is clear throughout the essay; you believe that storytelling by parents is critical for children's development and the parent-child relationship. However, making sure your arguments support this view consistently will strengthen your essay. Double-check your essay to ensure that each argument aligns with your stance and does not contradict it.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: You have provided arguments in favor of both parental storytelling and independent reading, highlighting their benefits to children. These arguments could be made more compelling with specific examples or research findings. For example, citing studies on the impact of storytelling on children's brain development could add weight to your claims.\n\nRemember to proofread your essay for punctuation errors, as they can impact the readability of your essay and affect your score. Mistakes such as using a comma instead of a period at the end of a sentence can lead to confusion and points deduction. \n\nImproving in these areas will not only make your arguments stronger but also enhance the overall coherence and persuasiveness of your essay. Keep practicing, and remember to always proofread your work for both minor and significant errors."}

As someone who is currently majoring in mechanical engineering, I am near the top of this pyramid-shaped hierarchy, but for most of my life I dreamed of being a music educator, a profession which stands very much near the bottom of the pyramid. The liberal and performing arts teach lessons that cannot be learned in any way other than getting a liberal and performing arts education. Any form of art will teach lessons that one never thought needed to be learned. To recognize the beauty in life and in death, to find happiness in desperation and resentment, to plant bravery out of the fear in all of us, that is what art forces someone to learn. \\n Why not place more value in developing and growing as people amongst people as opposed to festering a 'me against the world' complex? Why not place importance in flowing creativity? Why not compliment deep thought instead of monetary gain? \\n Reading this article is not my first exposure to questioning why my mathematical side is more valued in society than my philosophical side, but it is my first time writing down my scattered thoughts on it. Already my own emotions are becoming clearer and I can say I understand myself better. The self-care intertwined with understanding the world better is deeply and unfortunately underestimated. \\n There is a dire need for politicians who better understand the science of climate change and the long history of the Middle East, we need more policemen that can communicate sensitively when needed, more people that can understand ethical differences.

Here's how to make the essay even stronger and more effective:\n\n1. **Topic Response**: The essay successfully addresses a significant topic \u2013 the undervalued importance of liberal and performing arts in education and society. To strengthen the connection to the topic further, consider clearly stating if the essay is a response to a specific article or discussion. If it is, mention the article's title, author, publication date, and the outlet to give your arguments context and make it easier for readers to understand the background of your thoughts.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: Your writing is generally clear; however, paying closer attention to sentence structure could enhance readability. Shorter, more concise sentences might help convey your points more effectively. Be mindful of using 'there' instead of 'their' when you mean 'belonging to them'. Additionally, varying sentence structure and length can keep the reader engaged.\n\n3. **Author's Point of View**: Your stance on the value of arts education is clear and compelling. To solidify your point of view, it could be beneficial to include more specific examples or personal experiences that illustrate how arts have impacted you or others. This can make your argument more relatable to the reader.\n\n4. **Arguments**: You have laid out several persuasive arguments in favor of valuing liberal and performing arts more in our education system and society. To build on this, consider adding quotes or findings from studies that support your claims. Such evidence can make your arguments more convincing. Expanding on how the arts contribute to understanding complex issues, like climate science or ethics, could further strengthen your case.\n\n5. **Cohesion and Coherence**: While your essay has strong individual points, connecting them more explicitly can improve the essay's overall flow. Transition sentences that link each paragraph and argument together can help guide the reader through your essay smoothly.\n\n6. **Conclusion and Relevance**: The conclusion introduces new ideas rather abruptly, making it seem a bit disconnected from the rest of the essay. Concluding with a summary of your main points or reflecting on the broader impact of your arguments could provide a stronger and more cohesive ending.\n\nRemember, specificity is key. More detailed examples and a clearer connection to the article (if applicable) or general discussion about arts education would provide a solid foundation for your insightful viewpoint. This is a well-started draft with a powerful message; with some refinements, it can become even more impactful."}

However, I totally disagree with the statement. I believe that wild-animal protection should take the first priority as wild animals plays an significant role in the earth and human life. \\n First of all, wild animals help to maintain biodiversity as they are parts of eco-system. In other words, wild animals can be affected by different species and in turn , other species may have positive or negative impacts on them through food chains. It runs parallel to bricks of a building. If it loses only a bricks, it may be still unscathed. But when the number of risks are taken big enough, it will definitely collapse. Therefore, wild animals influence human beings directly or indirectly. \\n Secondly, wild animals devotes what the have to serving people. Not only their health but also their wealth and freedom. For example, tons of animals are forced to perform tricks in the circus nowadays. As we all know, they are punished severe and violently until they are able to do correctly what they are told. Also, it is not easy for bees to make honey- a nutritious item that not everyone can afford to buy. Bees have to go through a laborious process involving multiple steps to produce honey. In addition, but for wild animals, there would not be such places like zoos where people can have a closer look and understanding about wild life. In view of science, many diseases have been cured by using parts of animals' bodies. Scientists have more chances to discover new horizon on account of studying wild animals. So there's no doubt that wide animals is beneficial to human financially and scientifically. \\n To sum up, although wild animals do not seem to effect our daily lives like most of us feel, we should not underestimate the contribution of them. Effective protection methods need to be launched before it is too late to save wild animals in specific, save the earth and human beings in general.","human_feedback_text":"You have written a 344 word essay. The time allotment for this essay task is 40 minutes. Normally, this time frame would allow a student to write between 275-290 words. I am amazed you were able to write so many words for this task. However, I am not impressed by the large number of writing errors you made in this presentation. Repeated errors in grammar, vocabulary usage, coherence and cohesiveness all add up to prevent you from gaining a passing score. \\n While you did well in the prompt restatement, your use of metaphors are out of place. You should only use metaphors in non-academic writing. Since this is a clear academic discussion, you should use only related examples to avoid any confusion in relation to your discussion development. Avoid the use of slang English words such as \"tons\". \\n Your second paragraph is confusing to read. You went from discussing a circus to discussing bees, without using transition sentences or references. There is a clear lack of proper paragraph development, problematic reasoning presentation, and a lack of discussion direction. To solve this problem, you must use only one topic per paragraph or, use a clear transition that will connect one discussion topic to the next. However, the transition should be supported by examples that provide clarity on the connection of the two discussion topics.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Reflecting on the essay in response to the topic regarding the significance of wild animals in the 21st century and whether their protection is justifiable, it is clear that the essay addresses the prompt effectively.

The position that wild animal protection is crucial is consistently maintained throughout the essay. This is a strength that should be maintained in future essays.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** The essay exhibits numerous grammatical and vocabulary errors that detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing. For instance, \"an significant\" should be \"a significant,\" and proper punctuation usage needs attention, such as spacing after commas. Avoiding slang like \"tons\" and using precise language would improve the academic tone. Consider revising sentences for grammar and ensuring that words are used correctly to enhance readability and formality.\n\n3. **Point of View Clarity:** The point of view is clear, expressing disagreement with the notion that wild animal protection is a waste. However, the clarity of this viewpoint could be further enhanced by offering counterarguments to opposing views more distinctly, thereby strengthening the argument.\n\n4. **Arguments and Descriptions:** The essay presents arguments for the protection of wild animals, citing their role in biodiversity and benefits to humanity. However, the arguments occasionally lack coherence and specificity. Utilizing metaphors, as seen with the bricks analogy, can be effective in non-academic contexts but might confuse readers in academic argumentation. It's advisable to support arguments with clear, directly related examples and data when possible.\n\n5. **Paragraph and Argument Development:** The transition between ideas within paragraphs is somewhat abrupt, particularly from discussing circuses to bees, without clear logical progression. This disrupts the flow and makes the essay harder to follow. Introducing smoother transitions and dedicating each paragraph to a single, well-developed idea would greatly improve coherence. For example, when shifting topics, a connecting sentence could bridge the topics by highlighting the common theme of exploitation or contribution to human life, making the argument more persuasive and easier to follow.\n\nIn summary, focusing on refining grammar and vocabulary, maintaining academic tone, ensuring clear and logical progression of ideas, and supporting arguments with directly relevant examples will significantly improve future essays. The foundation is strong, with a clear stance and relevant arguments; building upon these with the suggested improvements will contribute to a more convincing and polished essay."}

Global warming also participates in these group of problems, which causes a variety of natural disasters and put the human in the dangerous situation. Governments or individuals have to have some measures to solve the increase of planet temperature, I will show it in this essay. \\n Some people only know global warming is an issue that people are facing but they do not know the dangerous perspective of its cause. For instance, increasing global temperature leads to melting of the polar ice caps, which creates the rise of sea levels. Therefore, the living are of people will be covered by water. In addition, the high of earth's average temperatures also get harmful for the wildlife habitats. For example, the melting of polar ice caps in North Pole and South Pole relate to the unavailable standard temperature of penguin or polar bear for living. Climate change produce extreme weather conditions. According to the recent analyses, there are thousands of forest fire every year all over the world. Some experts assess that global warming posed a serious threat. Not only does it make harm for asset but it also threatens to human's life. \\n There are some measures to solve this problem. The government have to introduce laws to citizens in making the fossil fuels. In Vietnam, the government imposed more stringent regulations on people, who burn the waste in an unsuitable place, they can be fined one million Vietnam dong if they do. In addition, some organizations also can propaganda and promote public awareness in people. For example, the environmental organization in Singapore have created a tree planting day for people in order to cover the green on barren area and reduce the carbon emissions. Furthermore, the individual also have to have their own consciousness to protect the environment. \\n In conclusion, the human have to act right now to call for urgent action on climate change and keep of the dangers of natural disasters.

Although the ideas are there, these are not properly developed so the essay feels improperly discussed or, under developed in presentation.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"Your essay presents a clear recognition of the pressing environmental issues we face, primarily focusing on global warming and its wide-ranging effects. However, to make your argument more compelling and easier to follow, consider these suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Relevance to Topic**: You've successfully identified global warming as a critical issue but spreading your focus across too many sub-topics without clear connections makes your argument less powerful. Try to narrow down your discussion to a few closely related issues. This helps maintain the essay's relevance and enhances its impact.\n\n2. **Coherence and Organization**: The essay jumps between different ideas, like the effects of global warming and measures to combat it, without showing how they connect. For a stronger essay, outline your main points before you start writing. This preparation helps you create a more logical flow of ideas. For instance, explain how burning fossil fuels directly contributes to global warming and then discuss specific measures to reduce this practice.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style**: There are a few grammatical and spelling errors in your essay which can distract readers from your message. Remember to check for subject-verb agreement (e.g., \"the government have\" should be \"the government has\") and use plurals correctly (\"the human\" should be \"humans\"). Also, using more varied sentence structures can make your essay more engaging.\n\n4. **Clarity of Point of View**: Your perspective on the need for immediate action against climate change is clear, which is excellent. To make your point of view even stronger, provide more detailed examples and evidence that directly support your arguments. For example, when discussing solutions, explain how specific measures have effectively reduced carbon emissions.\n\n5. **Descriptive Arguments**: While you mention several issues and solutions, the discussion sometimes feels superficial. Delve deeper into a few key points rather than briefly touching on many. For example, instead of simply stating that wildlife habitats are harmed, describe the exact impact on specific species and ecosystems to illustrate the seriousness of the situation more vividly.\n\n6. **Addressing the Essay's Structure**: The essay would benefit significantly from a well-defined structure: introduction, body paragraphs focusing on particular aspects of the issue, and a conclusion reiterating the urgency of action and encompassing the essay's main points. Each paragraph should ideally explore a single idea, contributing to the overall argument cohesively.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, especially focusing on narrowing down the topic and ensuring a logical flow of information, your essay will become more effective and persuasive.

By the same token, the preponderance of countries are likely to possess a huge number of teenagers, which is more than that of elder. Despite the fact that everything has its own perks, i personally believe that this is an efficacious phenomenon having a great deal of virtues that definitely outweigh the drawbacks. \\n Firstly, it is argued that young adults will bring to the society a multitude of advantages especially in terms of human resources. As we know,the more the country has developed, the more inventions and products must be spawned .Therefore,having a rise in the population of young generations is immensely significant proven by the pivotal roles of their creativity and physical strengths. Moreover, this phenomenon also represents a necessary replacement for the elderly who have the inability to provide effective and creative products to the country. According to a recent study by Boston University, despite the fact that everyone has their own lifespan, they all have a similar period of time that could provide the most efficient production and it often lasts for 25 years from 20 to 45 years old. After that, the majority of people will have a tendency to decline their productivity more than a half compared with that of the past. Thus, this makes it clear that having a great deal of young adults could ensure the process of developing the country. \\n To add credence to my assertion, several baleful upshots of having a large number of old people which is much more than that of young people are factors that i will point out next. According to the government, everyone has their own rights to receive specific payments and insurances which ensure the stability of their life after retiring. Moreover, the costs of these services are taken from the budget of the government and taxes of workers. Therefore, it is discernibly understandable that the country will have an extreme economic repercussion if old people expand their lifespan more than the period that the government expected. Meanwhile,young generations could compensate for the loss of money and produce constant incomes to stabilize the economy of the country. For example, the BBC news reported in June 2018 that Japan - the country that possesses a great number of elders having longest life spans - suffered from a significant downward trend of the economy and lost its rank in the world hierarchy by virtues of an increase in the population of the elderly to nearly 80 years old on average .All things considered, the phenomenon of having multiple young adults more than old people will reduce the huge amount of money of services for elderly people. \\n To encapsulate,although every situation has both advantages and drawbacks, I absolutely reckon that having a huge number of young generations will bring more efficacious implications for society by virtue of a constant source of incomes and the ability to compensate the amount of money that serves as public services for retired people.","human_feedback_text":"This being your first attempt at writing a task 2 essay, I can see the problems within your work.

Wrong word choices in the same sentence also show a high unfamiliarity with the English language and will add to his sectional deductions. Your writer's opinion presentation is also incomplete as you only present a quick response to one of the two questions, thus making the response inaccurate \/ incomplete for the purpose of task accuracy. \\n Your response format is highly inaccurate as he fails to provide the correct 3-5 sentence discussions per paragraph for each question. The GRA score of the essay, along with the C+C section will not be considered for a passing score because of these incomplete thought presentations and under developed reasoning paragraphs. The conclusion does not fair well either. It does not follow the correct summary conclusion format as depicted in the requirements. As such, this is an essay that will not even come close to a base passing score. It is definitely a failing essay presentation.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay explores the importance of owning a home versus renting, emphasizing the stability and peace of mind homeownership can bring. While the topic is relevant, there are several areas for improvement to make this essay more effective and aligned with English proficiency test standards.\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** The essay addresses the topic but lacks a direct response to a specific question or a clear argument structure. It's important to directly answer any questions posed in the prompt and structure the essay with a clear introduction, body paragraphs (each with a single clear idea supported by examples or explanations), and a conclusion.\n\n2. **Word Count:** The essay falls short of the required word count for most English proficiency tests, which is typically around 250 words. Meeting the word count is crucial as falling short can significantly impact your score. Expanding on the ideas presented, providing more detailed examples, and further explaining the reasons behind your opinion could help increase the length of the essay.\n\n3. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** There are numerous errors in spelling, grammar, and word choice throughout the essay. For instance, \"they think having themselves a home than renting one is very vital\" could be corrected to \"some people believe owning a home rather than renting one is very important.\" Incorrect verb tenses and pluralization (\"has been take in people's mind many years\" should be \"has been taken to heart by many people for years\") also detract from the clarity. Improving these elements will not only make the essay easier to understand but also demonstrate proficiency in English.\n\n4. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:** Your point of view is present but not clearly articulated. Starting with a clearer thesis statement that outlines your main argument would strengthen the essay. For instance, \"I believe that owning a home provides financial stability and emotional peace, outweighing the benefits of renting.\"\n\n5. **Arguments and Support:** The arguments made are relevant but lack depth and specific examples. For each point made about the benefits of homeownership, include real-life examples, statistical data, or hypothetical scenarios that demonstrate these benefits. This will make your arguments more convincing and your essay more engaging.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The conclusion should succinctly summarize the main points made in the essay and reinforce the author's viewpoint. Currently, it feels abrupt and lacks a strong final statement that ties all your arguments together. A more effective conclusion might restate the significance of homeownership in achieving a better life, reflecting the points made throughout the essay.\n\nImproving these areas will not only help meet the requirements of an English proficiency test but also enhance the overall coherence, persuasiveness, and readability of the essay. Remember, practice and review are key to developing strong writing skills."}

David's article presents empirical evidence on the importance of technology in education. In general, it is a very good and positive prediction when technology has not developed strongly. \\n In 2011, the EduTech National Congress, a conference and exhibition of educational technology, was started with 520 attendees. David Glance, director of UWA Centre for Software Practice, reported the information of this conference and based on it, along with his personal opinion, wrote \"Educational technology and the future of the classroom\". According to David, technology has a very important position in the field of education, but he also advises us to apply it reasonably and expect schools to accept the application of information technology in teaching. \\n In the article, the author mentioned the benefits of technology in education. For example, the transition from using regular text books to increasingly interactive online teaching tools, or children spent 9 months to achieve the computer literacy of the average office worker. However, there were a lot of obstacles to the adoption of technology in education 7 years ago. Online courses were not everyone's concern at that time, and governments viewed education in a short-term perspective, countries were driven by test scores (Sir Ken Robinson). David didn't use technical or specialized vocabulary and avoided terms that may be unfamiliar to readers in order for general audience to understand. Moreover, he formulated an opinion based on his experience and observation, with other people's quotes (Sir Ken Robinson) to support his point. Finally, this article was carried out in 2014, at that time, there was a lot of controversy. But in recent years as technology has developed, people have seen the positive when applying these technologies to education so it is up-to-dated. \\n In conclusion, the author wrote this article to affirm the importance of technology in education as well as raising people's awareness about the issue of educational technology. This article, therefore, should be highly appreciated.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>presents empirical evidence on the importance of technology in education<\/quotation> \\n Based on what thesis?

Here are some points to help you improve your essay:\n\n1. **Response to Topic:** You've attempted to summarize the article and express its positive view on educational technology. However, it's crucial to directly answer any specific question posed in the essay prompt. Ensure your essay directly addresses the prompt, including any specific aspects it asks for, such as the author's argument development or the implications of technology in education.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:**\n   - Avoid contractions (e.g., use \"did not\" instead of \"didn't\") to maintain a formal tone appropriate for academic essays.\n   - Be careful with the spelling of words and names. For instance, always use the author's last name (e.g., Glance) rather than their first name to maintain a formal and respectful tone.\n   - Consider varying your sentence structure to create a more engaging and readable essay. Short and long sentences can be used together to keep the reader's interest.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your essay shows an understanding of the author's positive stance on educational technology. However, detailing your perspective, whether you agree or disagree with the author, and why, could strengthen your essay. Expressing your viewpoint clearly can make your essay more compelling.\n\n4. **Arguments and Supporting Evidence:**\n   - The essay mentions that the article presents \"empirical evidence\" but doesn't elaborate on this evidence. For an improved analysis, specify what this evidence is and discuss how it supports the article's arguments.\n   - When referencing the benefits and obstacles related to technology in education, dive deeper. Ask yourself, \"Why are these points important?\" and \"How do they support or challenge the author's main argument?\" Present these findings in your essay.\n   - Addressing the controversies and changes over time with specific examples or further explanation would enrich your essay. Discuss what these controversies were and how perspectives on educational technology have evolved.\n\n5. **Critical Analysis:** Your essay tends to summarize the article rather than critically analyze it. Critical analysis involves examining the arguments presented, assessing both strengths and weaknesses, and considering the evidence's validity. Questions like \"What discussion topics were valid and why?\" and \"How is the information from the EduTech National Congress relevant to the article's main argument?\" can prompt deeper thought and analysis.\n\nIn summary, while your essay effectively summarizes the article's viewpoint on the positive impact of technology in education, more critical analysis, direct engagement with the essay prompt, and attention to detail in spelling, grammar, and style could enhance your submission. Aim to present a balanced discussion by evaluating the arguments and evidence critically, and ensure your point of view is clear and well-supported throughout your essay."}

Feel free to give advice. Thanks a lot! \\n It is undeniable that students possess different levels of academic capacities. Therefore, some arguments stated that educational institutions need to classify students based on their qualifications. Others claim that students with various types of abilities had better study in the same class. In my opinion, we should categorize students only in high schools and universities. \\n The most supported reason for choosing students according to their academic abilities is to guarantee the general improvement of the class. Having the same qualification, students can be taught by the same teaching methods without fears of being left behind or underestimated by teachers or classmates. However, this class type may discourage students from striving to get outstanding academic results. \\n On the contrary, the main advantage of studying with students of different capacities is that strengths and weaknesses are shared with each other. While well-qualified students seem to be boring and lack of soft skills, the others with low study marks, who really need help from not only teachers but also their well-studied classmates, always bring entertainments to the class. Nevertheless, this kind of class may sparks conflicts between excellent students and the below-average ones due to some disagreement. \\n To the best of my knowledge, I believe that classifying students based on their academic abilities should only be done in high school and higher education. Due to the necessity of socialization in childhood, students in primary and secondary schools need to learn how to treat others of different qualifications properly. From the age of 16, they are able to realize their academic capacities and very sensitive when it comes to being compared to excellent students. Therefore, high schools need to select students according to their studious capacities. \\n In conclusion, studying with students of either different or the same academic abilities are essential for the overall development. However, categorization should only be done by high schools and universities.","human_feedback_text":"Your opinion should not have been stated in the opening paraphrase.

The opinion you present should be a culmination of the comparative discussion of the 2 public points of view. The only choices you have for the discussion are based on the provided information.

However, there are several areas for improvement to make the essay clearer and more persuasive.\n\n1. **Response to Topic**: The essay attempts to address the topic but introduces the author's opinion too early. In an essay, especially for English proficiency tests, it's crucial to first outline the discussion according to the task instructions. Only after comparing the two public opinions should the personal viewpoint be introduced. The personal opinion should emerge as a result of evaluating the points made rather than appearing unconnected to the discussion.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, or Stylistic Issues**: The essay is generally well-written but contains some stylistic and minor grammatical errors. For instance, phrases like \"lack of soft skills\" might be better expressed as \"lacking in soft skills\". Avoid generalizations like \"always bring entertainments to the class,\" which could be more precisely stated as \"can contribute to a more engaging class environment\". Ensure verb tense consistency and clear subject-verb agreement throughout the essay.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View**: While the author's point of view is evident, the essay would benefit from a clearer separation between the discussion of public opinions and the introduction of the author's own stance. Use neutral language to describe the two viewpoints initially (\"some people\" and \"others\"), reserving personal pronouns (\"I believe\", \"In my opinion\") for when you articulate your personal opinion. This distinction helps the reader understand when you are presenting others' viewpoints versus your own.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: The essay presents reasons for and against classifying students by academic abilities but can improve in specificity and coherence. Each viewpoint should be discussed thoroughly with clear, separate reasons before introducing the personal opinion. In the conclusion, clearly distinguish between the summary of the topic, the reasons for the first and second points of view, and your own reasoned opinion. This structure not only aids in clarity but also strengthens the persuasiveness of your argument.\n\nFurthermore, to enhance the essay's clarity and impact, consider more specific examples to support each argument. Demonstrating how categorization affects student performance or morale with concrete examples can make the arguments more compelling. Lastly, ensure a balanced discussion by giving equal attention to both viewpoints before stating your preference, reinforcing your essay's objectivity and analytical depth.\n\nBy focusing on these suggestions, the essay can be significantly improved in terms of clarity, coherence, and persuasive power.

Secondly, the author refer to eight biases that can happen during an interview, such as The Halo Effect Bias, The Contrast Bias and Cultural Noise Bias. Through these biases I feel that interviewers base biases on cognitive biases that cause them to evaluate may not be accurate. Also, they can choose wrong candidates versus job requirements.

However, it lacks a clear stance in agreement or disagreement with the article discussed. An opinion essay should clearly state your position on the matter and give specific reasons for that stance, supported by examples or evidence from the article.

For instance, the phrase \"it's effect to the interviewer's decisions\" should be corrected to \"its effect on the interviewer's decisions.\" Consistent errors in subject-verb agreement (\"a bias can be,\" \"a job applicant make\") and singular\/plural forms (\"bias\" vs. \"biases,\" \"a person\" vs. \"people\/candidates\") are noticeable.

In my opinion, I disagree with this statement and advocate for the same importance between them. \\n Studying the local history is surely indispensable part of school curriculum. The reason is that historical knowledge paves a way to patriotism, which must be established from little understanding of what happened in the past, how hometown changed over time and so on. Since then, people's hearts have blossomed with their pride of origin and desire of sovereignty protection. Additionally, domestic historical acquisition may serve as a middle man to call for people's contribution. Hardy people does build up their hometown when they have no local sympathetic. Once people heartedly know about where they were born, they get ready to invest to develop their motherland at any costs. \\n From another angle, world history should share the same significance with the former. Knowledge about world equips people with more well-rounded perspectives of life. For example, lessons of World War explicitly reminds us of peace's value and understanding of Feminism encourages people to protest against Gender discrimination and abuse. By and large, these kinds of knowledge would enhance people's mind related to various corners of life. Furthermore, looking at the world historically benefits people in their integration process.

The prompt asks for a position to be taken regarding the importance of teaching local or world history in schools. While your essay provides a thoughtful discussion on the value of both, it overlooks the requirement to choose one and argue in its favor exclusively.

Paying closer attention to verb agreement and sentence structure can greatly improve the readability and professionalism of your essay. Additionally, consider simplifying complex sentences to enhance clear communication of your ideas.\n\n3. **Clarity of Viewpoint:** Your position, though presented, is muddled by the attempt to argue for the importance of both local and world history equally.

However, these arguments are presented in a way that attempts to balance both, rather than focusing on defending a single chosen standpoint. Concentrating on developing arguments for one side could make your essay more persuasive and aligned with the prompt. For example, if choosing to advocate for local history, delve deeper into how it specifically fosters patriotism and community development, using more concrete examples and perhaps comparisons to the lesser focus on world history.\n\nIn conclusion, your essay demonstrates a thoughtful approach to the topic but needs to more closely follow the specific instructions given in the essay prompt. Focusing on one side of the argument, refining your grammar and sentence structure, and ensuring your thesis clearly reflects your chosen stance will help improve your essay's effectiveness and coherence.

Avoid broad discussions on the evolution of educational systems unless they directly support your argument.\n   - In the second discussion about marrying at a young age, your argument should specifically highlight the advantages of marrying young if that's the position you choose to defend. Avoid introducing comparisons not requested by the prompt, unless you are directly contrasting to strengthen your chosen stance.\n\n2. **Structural and Stylistic Issues:**\n   - Your writing demonstrates a good level of complexity and vocabulary. However, be mindful of run-on sentences and ensure each sentence is clear and concise.\n   - It would be beneficial to organize your thoughts more clearly by introducing, supporting, and concluding your arguments within each paragraph, rather than mixing different ideas.\n   \n3. **Clarity of Author's Point of View:**\n   - Your point of view is somewhat clear but can be made stronger. Each paragraph should open with a clear statement of your position on the prompt\u2019s question. Follow this with specific reasons and examples to support your viewpoint.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:**\n   - While you've mentioned reasons and implications related to the topics, delve deeper into specific examples to back up your claims. This enriches your essay and makes your arguments more convincing.\n\n5. **Preparation Strategy:**\n   - Practicing writing in sections can indeed help hone individual skills. However, considering the format of proficiency tests, it is equally important to practice writing full essays within a time limit. This will better prepare you for the actual test environment and help improve your ability to construct a coherent argument within the given time.\n\nRemember, the goal of these proficiency tests is not only to assess your English language skills but also to evaluate your ability to structure thoughts in a logical and coherent manner. Aligning your practice more closely with the test requirements will not only improve your writing skills but also enhance your overall test performance. Keep practicing, and focus on these areas of improvement for better results."}

For small and medium companies, their budgets may be limited and have to be allocated economically to lots of departments. In these cases, they tend to choose sales solutions which do not cost too much money. Online companies, for example, opt for marketing campaigns on social networks or third party's platform to boost their sales in lieu of marketing on media, which often charges bunches of money for each advertising minute. For large corporates whose budgets are sufficient for launching long term sales promotions, they will approach targeted customers by diversified methods, such as advertising on televisions, setting up signboards, or co - operating with key opinion leaders. Some luxury and exclusive brands, though possess themselves huge financial resources, choose to not advertise in common ways, but their sales always rise significantly because of their insightful knowledge about customers.

The introduction immediately dives into the variety of sales strategies without first clearly stating that the essay will discuss different sales methods and evaluate which might be the most effective.

Furthermore, in the sense that the extent of content is limited, there would be a decrease in the number of people who take interest in this field. Secondly, performing under control may bore artists and make them lose interest in their career, as their ideas tend to be restricted by laws and policies.

Kilian not only mentions the difference between sex and gender she also talks about the cultural and social system that still is based on inequality and is full of hegemonic masculinity. \\n Changing Concepts of Gender is her first subchapter which informs the reader about how the early Women Studies in the 1960s got shifted into the Gender Studies. This shift gave emphasis on the structural function of gender in society. Further, the chapter explains the difference between sex and gender. Sex is the biological difference between male and female and gender refers to the social and cultural differentiation of masculinity and femininity. Gender is mostly used as an identity. The difference between those terms can be further specified in sociological and psychological perspectives to analyze the ongoing relations in the system of gender. The relations in societies structure are still underlying the hegemonic masculinity. This term displays the field of multiple shifting masculinities divided into two e.g. gay men are subordinated to hegemonic men according to Connell. The second subchapter dives into the topic of Transgender Studies, Queer Theory and the contributions of Michel Foucault and Judith Butler into this field of study. The chapter talks about the strengthening that heteronormativity has on the connection between heterosexuality and gender. Heterosexuality is the cultural that happens through the coherence of sex, gender and sexuality. However, the theoretical approach of heteronormativity highlights the dependence of gender and sexuality, which could raise complications to identify gender as its own category. The third and last subchapter, which is also the last main argument, is based on Gender and Sexuality in English and American Studies. It is said that gender is a main defining organization principle in culture and society and has become important to be able to analyze literary studies. Furthermore, the text explains, that Queer Theory accentuates the \"third space\" (transgender, queergender) to rearrange the binary system. Lastly it touches on the subject of feminist narratology and queer narratology and how it provoked the so-called norm of gender and sexuality. That homophobia and the homosexual panic are excused by the heterosexual structure men determine. \\n Kilian not only used evidence to support her work, she ended her chapter by stating the strongest argument saying that such an oppressed topic awakened fear in some and created a \"panic\". The text was in a chronological order and touched upon subjects that still are major nowadays. Gender Studies are still developing and yet to be explored. It is one of the main topics not only in literature but in society. Kilian wrote these subchapters in a coherent and progressing way, beginning with the history and ending it with the ongoing obstacles. Gender Studies is a very sensitive topic one should approach with respect. To explain, that the oppression of women started this study and shifted towards the general term Gender Studies was very clever.

You have attempted to outline the contents and provide insight into complex issues of gender studies. However, there are areas in your essay that could be improved to enhance clarity, depth, and responsiveness to the essay topic.\n\n1. **Responsiveness to the Topic:** It's important for your essay to not just list the contents of the text but also critically engage with it. Instead of only summarizing each subchapter, try to weave in an analysis of how these concepts impact society or specific fields. Reflect on how these studies challenge or contribute to existing knowledge and why that is important.

Avoid long, complex sentences that can confuse the reader. Breaking them into shorter sentences can help in conveying your points more clearly. Additionally, ensuring consistent tense and perspective throughout the essay will improve its professionalism and readability.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Make your stance or perspective on the subject more evident. While summarizing the chapters, integrate your interpretation or critique of the material. For example, what do you think about the shift from Women Studies to Gender Studies? Do you see the relevance of these studies in current social contexts? Expressing your viewpoint will make the essay more engaging and personal.\n\n4. **Supportive Arguments:** Your essay mentions various important concepts but lacks detailed explanations or examples to support these ideas. When discussing topics like hegemonic masculinity or the role of gender in literature, provide specific examples or theoretical arguments to support your discussion. This not only shows your understanding of the material but also strengthens your essay by grounding abstract ideas in concrete examples.\n\nAdditionally, consider reflecting on what you've learned from the text and how it has influenced your perspective on gender studies. Sharing personal insights or questioning the material shows critical engagement and can make your essay more compelling.\n\nLastly, gender studies is indeed a sensitive and multi-dimensional field that intersects with various aspects of society and culture. Your essay hints at an appreciation of this complexity. Delving deeper into these aspects, especially how they relate to contemporary issues or personal observations, could add significant value to your analysis.\n\nImproving these elements will not only make your essay more responsive to the topic but also more informative and engaging for the reader.

This supports the idea that universities should ensure a completely equitable distribution of students in every subject. While this might seem to be a practical suggestion at first, I am strongly against this proposal for certain reasons. \\n Firstly, this seems to be unrealistic when an overview of the variation of the gender ratio across the world has shown the number of males relative to females is male-biased in almost every country, this ratio is around 105 males per 100 females. This means it is impossible for universities to arrange an exactly equal number of boys and girls into every major. Otherwise, if this situation is capable of implementation, the arrangement is unfair for both. In each subject, every university has a quantity of entry-level, the entrance of students will be decided by their total points, and obviously, it is filtered from top to bottom, the higher of scores, the higher of chances a student matriculates. However, in the case of being equal in males and females, for example, if a girl with a higher mark than a boy, to ensure a balanced number of boys and girls in one class, forcing the university to choose the boy instead of another one. This is actually unacceptable. \\n Besides, not every man and woman is suited to all the majors based on their overall abilities and interests. For instance, some science subjects are mainly not done well by women, such as mathematics, computer science, technology, and other fields of knowledge, which are totally dominated by males. Despite the noticeable progress that has been achieved in acknowledging that men and women both can be capable in science, female employees may still face evident discrimination in male-dominated work environments. Therefore, it is challenging for women to compete with men in such fields. Similarly, it is hard for male students to learn embroidery as it is for female students to study anatomy. As this shows, it is right to expect boys and girls to have separate academic pursuits and choose their majors on their own. \\n To conclude, I must affirm once again, it is neither realistic nor necessary to accept equal numbers of males and females in universities. Labeling this opinion as \"a symbol of fairness\" totally cannot be supported.","human_feedback_text":"The writer will lose points for not properly restating the simple, one liner topic sentence as provided.

However, there are several areas where this essay could be improved to more effectively convey its message and adhere to the guidelines of an English proficiency test essay.\n\n1. **Response to the topic and structure**: The essay somewhat strays from a direct response to the prompt by not restating or clearly defining the essay's stance in the initial paragraph. The introduction should succinctly state the topic and the author's position to set a clear foundation for the arguments that follow. A concise thesis statement at the end of the introduction is essential for outlining the essay's main argument and would help the reader understand the perspective right from the beginning.\n\n2. **Spelling, grammar, or stylistic issues**: There are no major spelling mistakes, but the essay could benefit from improved grammar and style. Some sentences are overly complex and could be simplified for clarity and ease of reading. It's also important to ensure that each paragraph sticks to 3-5 sentences to maintain conciseness and focus, as recommended for English proficiency tests. This would make the essay more accessible to all readers and align with test expectations.\n\n3. **Clarity of the point of view**: The essay's point of view is clear but could be expressed more effectively with structured reasoning. Each argument should be introduced with a topic sentence, followed by supporting details, and concluded in a way that reinforces the essay\u2019s overall stance. This structure will aid in delivering a coherent and persuasive argument against forced gender balance.\n\n4. **Arguments and Descriptions**: The essay provides examples to support its position, like the impracticality of equal gender distribution and the natural differences in interests and competencies between genders. However, these arguments can sometimes come across as over-generalizations, particularly regarding gender abilities in certain subjects. It's critical to base such arguments on evidence and present them sensitively to avoid inadvertently reinforcing stereotypes. Additionally, the argument presentation could be more nuanced, recognizing that while forcible gender equity might be impractical, there are underlying issues of access and representation that warrant discussion.\n\nTo enhance this essay:\n- Restate the topic and clearly articulate the thesis statement in the introduction.\n- Adhere to a simpler sentence structure and maintain the recommended sentence count per paragraph.\n- Ensure that arguments are not only clear and descriptive but also carefully phrased to avoid generalizations.\n- Each paragraph should focus on one main idea, supporting the overall thesis with evidence and reasoned arguments.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the essay would present a more compelling, clear, and respectful argument against enforced gender balance in university enrollments, better aligning with the expectations for English proficiency test essays."}

The given assignment asks to weigh the advantages against the disadvantages of damaging unexploited regions for energy resources. The essay, however, discusses the effects but does not clearly take a side, as required by the prompt. Essays in this context are expected to present a singular viewpoint - either stating that advantages outweigh the disadvantages or vice versa - and then support that stance throughout. It would be beneficial to revise the essay with a clear stance that aligns with the expectation of providing a singular, supported opinion.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues**: There are minor spelling and grammatical errors that need attention:\n   - Usage of \"i\" instead of \"I\" for first-person pronouns.\n   - Missing spaces after commas and periods, which are necessary for clarity and readability.\n   - Consistency in verb tense and proper sentence structure could enhance the flow of the essay.\n   \n   Paying closer attention to these details can significantly improve the readability and professionalism of the essay.\n\n3. **Point of View Clarity**: The essay's point of view is somewhat unclear due to the approach of discussing both effects without taking a definitive stance. By explicitly stating your viewpoint on whether the advantages or disadvantages are more significant, and then consistently supporting this viewpoint throughout the essay, the argument would become clearer and more persuasive.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support**: While the essay attempts to present arguments for both sides, it's crucial for strengthening the chosen viewpoint with more defined and descriptive arguments. This includes providing specific examples, facts, or data that clearly support your stance.

Others disagree and think that a good salary leads to a better life. \\n Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. \\n Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. \\n Write at least 250 words. \\n Answer \\n Currently, there are two major streams of opinions regarding the importance of workplace interest and salary. While some people prioritize their satisfaction with the work they do, some value a great paycheck more than the amusement of their jobs. This essay would examine, discuss these viewpoints and, ultimately, give the opinion of the writer. \\n First of all, some people may like the idea of having a well-paid job because it would enable them to have more freedom in life. It is a fact that nowadays, everything - major or minor - costs you money. Therefore, a job that pays well would enable workers to buy whatever they need without thinking twice. Thus, they would have greater freedom to get and try things in life without many restrictions, both mentally and financially. For example, having a well-paid job would free them from contemplating choosing which drinks to buy, while also enable them to buy without taking out a loan. Also, by gaining financially early in their career, they may be able to save up enough money for retirement, which would give them the ultimate freedom of life and the ability to do away with their repetitive jobs. In that way, money would attract people with a desire to live a free and comfortable life. \\n On the other hand, I also get that some people want to have a real connection with their jobs, their fellow workers, and their workplace. As an employee, having a satisfying job would mean less stress and more confidence in the workplace and life. An enjoyable occupation would make people feel cheerful and excited all the time, as they are following their passion and interest while making a living. Therefore, emotional and stress breakdowns are less likely to happen. Consequently, being excited to go to work can help an individual perform better in their tasks, as they would try harder to solve problems instead of resigning themselves. Repeatedly, this can build up one's confidence. Having a job that suits you well is certainly a great choice for those who want a worry-free life. \\n From my point of view, I would lean towards having a job you like.

This approach will enhance the coherence of your essay.\n\n4. **Concluding Paragraph:** The conclusion should be a summary of the arguments presented rather than the introduction of new information or a reiteration of your personal opinion. Aim to concisely summarize both viewpoints discussed and how they contribute to understanding the overarching topic.\n\n5. **Spelling, Grammar, and Style:** Your essay is mostly free from spelling and grammatical errors. However, paying attention to stylistic nuances, such as varying sentence structure and employing a range of vocabulary, can further strengthen your writing. \n\n6. **Engagement and Details:** You've included relevant examples to support your points, which is commendable.

In my opinion, I disagree it. However, I believe that men and women have the same opportunities to study. \\n Firstly, having equal numbers of students in both genders may cause to reverse discrimination. Sexual discrimination and reverse discrimination both are not allowed in the modern cities. The schools should accept students base on their ability, relevant experience or other reasons but not their gender. People should not be benefited or demaged by their gender. \\n Secondly, people in different gender good at different things. It does not mean the sexual stereotype that how men or women should be, but they are physically different. For example, in biology, men is stronger and more powerful than women. Therefore, there are more male students in school of engineering, and their key of being there was their ability but not their gender. \\n Last but not the least, having the same quantity of male and female students in all programmes does not work in the reality. Registration of entering colleges or universities is a two way process. Even if the schools set the rule, the gender of the applicants may not be that equal. For example, there have been few male students applied the programme of nursing every year. They are not willing to study nursing because of serval reasons. So, will the university decreases the number of nursing students if they received not enough male student applications? So, it is not a good way to avoid sexual discrimination by controlling the numbers of male and female students. \\n In conclusion, there is not advantage to the society while enforcing universities to accept the same numbers of male and female students.","human_feedback_text":"Dear student, your opening statement created a severe topic deviation based upon the original prompt presentation. You should have stopped with \"I disagree\" instead of making an additional comment about \"same opportunities to study\" because that create the thesis statement for your essay, which was not part of the original discussion. The thesis statement is always the last sentence in the opening statement paraphrase and as such, represents the discussion instruction based on the required opinion. In fact, your response about the opinion is also wrong because you merely \"disagreed\" when the essay is requiring you to issue an emotional response based on the \"extent\" indication in the instruction. You have to use descriptive terms such as \"strongly, totally, partially, unequivocally\" to represent your \"extent\" opinion in the opening paraphrase. Make sure to properly use the opening paragraph in the manner required because a major portion of your final score will be based on the representation of your English comprehension skills in this section of the scoring guide. \\n By the way, the concluding statement is meant to be a summary of your provided discussion. It cannot be a single sentence at the end of the essay because a single sentence does not accurately summarize the discussion. Note that there is a standard 3 sentence minimum - 5 sentence maximum per paragraph and that includes the opening and concluding statement.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay addresses whether colleges and universities should enroll equal numbers of male and female students in all subjects. The main argument is against this idea, with various reasons provided to support this position. However, there are areas where the essay could be improved for clarity and effectiveness:\n\n1. **Clarity on the topic and position**: The introduction suggests disagreement with the idea of enforcing gender balance in college enrollments but then mentions belief in equal opportunities for study. For a stronger opening, clearly state the position right from the start, focusing on whether or not enforcing gender balance is beneficial, without introducing new arguments not directly related to the question.\n\n2. **Emphasizing the extent of agreement or disagreement**: When expressing disagreement or agreement with a statement, it's beneficial to indicate the strength of that position. Words like \"strongly,\" \"partially,\" or \"totally\" can help convey the extent of your stance more accurately.\n\n3. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style**: There are several instances where grammar and spelling can be improved to enhance readability and precision in the argument. For example, \"I disagree it\" should be \"I disagree with it,\" and \"demaged\" should be \"damaged.\" Attention to subject-verb agreement, as seen in \"people in different gender good at different things,\" which could be refined to \"people of different genders are good at different things,\" will also improve the essay's quality.\n\n4. **Clear Arguments**: While the essay provides reasons against forced gender balance in education, some arguments can be made clearer. For instance, discussing the natural differences between genders and their impact on educational choices could be enhanced by focusing on interests and abilities over physical strength. Additionally, providing concrete examples or data could strengthen these points.\n\n5. **Concluding Paragraph**: The conclusion of an essay should summarize the key points made rather than introducing new information. It should be more than a single sentence to effectively encapsulate the discussion. Aim for a minimum of three sentences that restate your main argument, summarize your supporting points, and perhaps reflect on the broader implications.\n\nRemember, cohesive and clear expression, along with proper grammar and structure, plays a crucial role in conveying arguments convincingly. Ensuring each paragraph consists of a minimum of three sentences and focusing on the clarity of your stance will greatly enhance your essay's persuasiveness and coherence."}

Some people consider learning about local history to be much more important than world history. I agree with this idea and will discuss several compelling reasons in this essay. \\n To begin with, local history provides school children with a firm foundation to understand their nation's singularity. To be more specific, learning about prestigious dynasties and historic events in the past would assist students in recognizing how weighty the merits of forefathers are. For instance, when learning about The August Revolution of Vietnam in 1945, about difficulties and fatalities that our forefathers had to face up with, schoolchildren would appreciate their forefathers' merits highly and treasure their nation's ongoing peace and independence. As a result, the youth could raise their awareness of preserving and developing the nation in recognition of their ancestors. \\n Furthermore, studying local history would give children more chances of developing interest in the whole subject of history, including world history. Because local history is more relevant and familiar to children as it is related to every aspect of their lives, learning about that would be an ideal basis for them to acquire knowledge of world history much easier. For example, children can make a comparison between events happening during a particular period in their nation and those in other nations, so they can understand the lessons thoroughly rather than merely reading and memorizing. \\n Some people may argue that if children hardly study world history, they will not be able to widen their knowledge about other nations, which is a disadvantage in this society of globalization. However, the fact is that a lot of school children nowadays learn history only by mesmerizing the timeframe, because they have to perceive a large amount of information about unfamiliar nations and people. Consequently, that will be a waste of time to study world history unless children change their mindset and are truly interested in history. \\n In conclusion, local history plays an indispensable role in the education system and should be given priority rather than world history. Besides, learning local history would also arouse children's enthusiasm for world history, thereby taking in overall acknowledgment about the world as well.","human_feedback_text":"The student makes a compelling restatement of the original topic.

This position comes through strongly, showcasing your ability to engage with the topic. Here are some points to consider for enhancing your writing:\n\n1. **Response to the Topic:** You've effectively restated the topic at hand and expressed your viewpoint with conviction. However, the depth of your opinion on why local history should be favored to such an extent could be further explored. While you do choose a side, expanding on the nuanced implications of this preference in the broader context of education and societal development would add depth to your argument.\n\n2. **Spelling, Grammar, and Stylistic Issues:** Your essay is well-written with few grammatical errors. To improve readability and impact, vary your sentence structure and use specific examples to highlight your points. This approach not only captures the reader's attention but also strengthens your arguments.\n\n3. **Clarity of Point of View:** Your perspective is clear throughout the essay. To enhance clarity, continuously link back your arguments to how they support your initial stance. This reinforces your viewpoint and keeps the reader focused on your primary assertion.\n\n4. **Arguments and Support:** You provide compelling reasons to prioritize local history, citing its significance in understanding national identity and its role as a foundation for engaging with world history. Introducing comparisons or statistics could further enrich your arguments. For example, discussing how knowledge of local history has improved students' understanding or interest in world history with specific references could offer tangible evidence to your claims.\n\nConcerning the structure and content, it's important to focus primarily on defending your opinion, especially when the essay prompt doesn't explicitly ask for a discussion of opposing views. The paragraph addressing potential counterarguments, while informative, slightly diverts attention from the central thesis. In future essays, concentrate more on elaborating and fortifying your chosen stance unless asked to address counterarguments directly. This will ensure a cohesive and focused argument.\n\nLastly, consider the overall structure of your essay to ensure each paragraph contributes toward advocating your main thesis. Avoid overextending your discussion beyond what's necessary to support your opinion. This streamlining will not only make your essay more concise but also allow for a deeper exploration of your chosen stance.\n\nIn summary, your essay demonstrates a strong inclination towards local history's importance, backed by relevant reasons. With slight adjustments focusing on depth of argument, evidence support, and structural clarity, you can significantly enhance the persuasive power of your essays."}

This is how Pentagram designers get their productivities and build a reputation as the biggest graphic design company in the world. \\n On the other hand, a sense of comfort at home is the reason why they can refresh the mind during work.

The use of these devices involves a set of drawbacks that need improving, but their benefits are much more noticeable. \\n On the one hand, exerting digital devices in learning may have some major disadvantages. The greatest downside of these gadgets is the distraction happening to students. Many students feel so bored in lessons as games, music and Facebook seem to be more intriguing to them. In fact, a study found that on average students check their phones more than 11 times a day in class. Obviously, it leads to a decline in their test results. Another negative aspect I want to mention is the prevalence of improper information. Since these devices are connected to the Internet, users are easily absorbed in negative and unofficial sources of information. For instance, false knowledge from an inappropriate book online may mislead students who read it. \\n On the other hand, although utilizing electronic devices in the domain of studying has several drawbacks, they offer users a variety of benefits. Initially, compared to traditional learning methods, these implements supply students with a more diverse source of information, pictures and videos, which assist in illustration while studying. By means of tablets, phones and laptops, students are more likely to have a better grasp of lessons. Furthermore, there are numerous applications utilized in studying. Rather than spending time on textbooks, teachers can allow students to listen to podcasts or improve pronunciation through voice recognition apps. Another point in favour of advantages is that electronic gadgets prompt students' self- reliance. Though there are questions whether numerous online sources of information are reliable or not, they are still served as helpful materials for students to learn on their own. For example, they are able to find the meaning of a word by looking up in a dictionary on their phone instead of asking teachers. \\n In short, exerting individual electronic devices in classroom has been a successful step in the revolution of learning methods.

For example, start the paragraph that discusses benefits with a sentence that explicitly mentions these benefits, such as \"On the other hand, electronic devices offer a variety of benefits.\" This approach helps in delivering a clear and organized discussion as per the essay prompt.\n\nIn discussing research or general facts, it's important to frame such information as commonly known rather than citing specific studies, especially since research cannot be conducted during the test. Instead of mentioning a study, you could say, \"It is a well-known fact that students often check their gadgets multiple times a day.\" This keeps the essay within the bounds of exam rules and maintains a formal tone.\n\nAdditionally, the use of personal pronouns and references to research could be minimized. Present information as if it is a matter of general knowledge, which helps maintain an academic and objective tone throughout the essay.\n\nThe essay tends to over-discuss certain points, which can lead to a loss in focus and clarity. To avoid this, consider creating a brief outline before starting to write. An outline helps organize your thoughts and ensures each paragraph stays on topic. For example, for disadvantages and advantages, respectively, outline the main point, the reason behind it, how it manifests, and a solution or enhancement. This structure not only keeps your essay focused but also makes writing easier and more efficient.\n\nIn the conclusion, succinctly repeat the main topic, cite a key disadvantage and advantage, and reiterate the overall impact of gadgets on learning. This recap ensures a strong end to the essay that ties back to the initial discussion points.\n\nThe essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but refining the structure, presentation of facts, and clarity can significantly improve its effectiveness and adherence to the discursive essay format. Reviewing additional examples can also provide insight into effectively navigating such prompts."}

Instead, it is highly recommended that people learn the cultures and traditions via books, films along with the internet. From my perspective, I partly subscribe to the notion above for some prime reasons as follows. \\n On the one hand, there are some compelling justifications why people could totally widen their horizons about the cultures' values of many places by using books, films and social networking sites. First and foremost, learning about cultures through reading books or using the internet is extremely affordable to the majority of the population. It is clearly explained that both conventional documents as well as the internet nowadays obviously not only comprise a great deal of information related to cultures and traditions in places but also are reasonably priced to humankind. As a result, people do not need to allocate much money on their visits to a range of places or nations in the world with a view to learning. For instance, only by reading books and surfing the internet regularly do candidates of The Olympia competition in Vietnam perfectly accomplish numerous challenging questions about cultures as well as languages of many nations. Secondly, learning from books or videos together with the internet also helps individuals to save time efficiently. This is because people these days usually suffer from heavy workloads and deadlines, as a result, they find it difficult to invest a long time in traveling. Therefore, learning cultures online and reading documents could be deemed sensible to them. \\n On the other hand, I also firmly think that it is quite essential for humans to contemplate the cultures and traditions of different countries by visiting because of two basic reasons. First of all, traveling to an array of destinations could bring visitors realistic experiences; therefore, they could deeply comprehend the core value of each culture genre. For example, when Vietnamese schools take their students to Bat Trang village, students could have a chance to try hard to make a product based on their creativity. By contrast, only learning from course books could not help them to attain any experiences like this. Last but not least, learning the cultures and traditions of numerous areas could be considered a recreational activity for someone. In fact, besides being exposed to a sheer number of different cultures along with gaining practical experiences, travelers also release anxiety significantly after working hard by enjoying the natural beauty of each landscape in these areas. \\n In conclusion, I strongly believe that both visiting different destinations and using books, videos along with the internet can give people an aid to widen their knowledge about the culture of each place. Thus, it is suggested that individuals should make use of two types of learning to gain more benefits from them.","human_feedback_text":"There is no reference to the 21st century in the original topic.

However, there are several areas where improvement is necessary to enhance clarity, coherence, and adherence to the essay prompt requirements.\n\n1. **Relevance to the Topic:** \nThe introduction includes references to the 21st century and a strong recommendation, neither of which are directly related to the original prompt. When responding to an essay topic, it's crucial to stick closely to what is being asked. Avoid introducing unrelated elements or presupposing recommendations not made in the prompt. Instead, focus on clearly rephrasing the essay question and stating your view without assuming additional recommendations or context not provided.\n\n2. **Essay Structure and Response Format:**\nThe essay uses a comparative discussion format, weighing the merits of learning about cultures through travel versus books, films, and the internet. However, this approach seems to misinterpret the expected response structure. If the prompt suggests discussing to what extent you agree with a statement, a balanced discussion reflecting this should be structured accordingly. Your opening should explicitly state your position in direct response to the question, and each paragraph should support this stance without implying a mixed or measured response unless specifically asked for.\n\n3. **Clarity and Coherence:**\nThe essay sometimes becomes complex due to the choice of language and sentence structure. Simplifying the language can make your arguments more accessible and your essay easier to follow for readers and examiners alike. Aim for clear and concise sentences, especially when explaining your reasoning.\n\n4. **Grammar, Spelling, and Style:**\nWhile the essay is largely well-written, paying close attention to grammatical consistency and avoiding redundancy will improve readability. For example, \"First and foremost\" and \"Last but not least\" are phrases that can be simplified to \"Firstly\" and \"Lastly\" without losing meaning. Additionally, ensure that your essay consistently adheres to either American or British spelling conventions to maintain stylistic coherence.\n\n5. **Argument Support and Development:**\nThe essay benefits from specific examples, like the reference to The Olympia competition in Vietnam and the visit to Bat Trang village. These are strong points because they provide concrete evidence to support the discussion. However, focusing on developing a few key arguments rather than attempting to cover too many might make your essay more compelling. Ensure each paragraph introduces a new point that directly supports your perspective, followed by examples or explanations that reinforce it.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion revisits the \"extent\" statement, which could confuse the reader about your stance. A more effective conclusion would succinctly recapitulate your main arguments and clearly state your final viewpoint without introducing new information. Ensure that your conclusion directly responds to the essay's prompt, emphasizing the strength of your position.\n\nBy focusing on these areas for improvement, your essay will be more focused, coherent, and directly responsive to the prompt.

In the light of this, many argue that libraries are outdated, and therefore, unfit for the demanding needs of the modern world. While I agree that the Internet is a powerful tool when it comes to information provision, I believe that libraries have their own importance in providing resources. \\n Admittedly, there are several reasons why people are in favor of searching information online over the traditional method of going to libraries. Firstly, in terms of time efficiency, the Internet allows us to access information at any time when it is convenient while libraries are only open for a certain number of hours a day and several days a week. People can also save a huge amount of time traveling as everything now is just one click away with the availability of online searching tools. Furthermore, the Internet is a reservoir of knowledge that is greater than any physical library, and it is getting updated every second. Therefore, to those who just need to get information in the fastest and easiest way, the Internet should be enough. \\n However, I believe that physical libraries still have special features that online sources can never replace. One of the key objectives of libraries is that it provides spaces which are specialized for studying. Particularly, every library has an academic environment with a quiet ambiance and less distraction to encourage deep concentration. This explains why many students still go to libraries to prepare for exams these days. In addition, people can always rest assured with the accuracy of the information they collected from libraries as books before being displaced in there have undergone strict processes of censoring by the ministry of education, and thus, it can be used officially for academic purposes or even scientific research. \\n In conclusion, although there are more and more alternative ways to attain information in this days and ages, I contend that libraries will still exist in the future for its unique value.","human_feedback_text":"<quotation>While I agree that ...I believe that libraries have their own importance in providing resources.<\/quotation> \\n The opinion of the writer is unclear.

It's essential for an essay, especially for proficiency tests, to have a clear stance. If your position is that libraries are still vital today despite the advent of digital information sources, make this clear from the beginning.

From my point of view, competition is positive in this case in spite of the increased emotional burden and weakened relationships it engenders. \\n One of the primary drawbacks of growing university competition is the mounting pressure it places on students. Intense competition often causes heightened stress levels, anxiety, and mental health problems. When the rate of enrollment decreases, many students experience overwhelming pressure to outshine their peers. To get a slot in university, countless students have to burn the candle at both ends, which often leads to sleep depression and enhances their level of stress. Consequently, this negative impact on mental health can hinder students' overall development and well-rounded growth. Furthermore, when they spend all their time studying, their relationships may be weakened because of lack of time to bond. \\n On the other hand, intense competition can also serve as a driving force that encourages students to strive for excellence and unleash their full potential. When faced with a highly cutthroat competition, students are motivated to become more concentrated, disciplined, and target-driven. They are then more likely to develop a strong work ethic, perseverance, and resilience, which are essential qualities for success in various aspects of life. From the government's perspective, this trend may contribute to the flourishing of these countries.

For instance, \"sleep depression\" might be \"sleep deprivation.\" Keeping sentences clear and precise will convey your message more effectively.\n\n5. **Clarity in Point of View**: Your conclusion successfully restates your viewpoint, which is excellent. However, ensure your point of view is clear throughout the essay, not just at the start and end. Strengthen your arguments by linking them directly to how they support your stance.\n\n6. **Development of Arguments**: The arguments about the impact on students' mental health and the potential for personal growth are good; however, they could be further developed with specific examples or evidence. Also, when discussing benefits to countries, be clearer about how the arguments you present support your overall viewpoint.\n\nRemember, your essay's effectiveness hinges on how clearly and coherently you can present and support your opinion. Focus on structuring your essay in a way that each part contributes to building your argument, ensuring clarity and precision in your language. This will make your essay stronger and more persuasive."}

Financial contribution for them would be supported by numerous statements, though fair compromise is not always possible due to the lack of funds. In that case we're forced to make a decision: should we stick to historical enlightenment or fulfill needs for piece of nature and place to rest? \\n Times when the good understanding of the closest living environment was sufficient for majority of our daily needs are irrevocably gone. Nowadays we live in the developed world that is exposed to the so called \"information overload\". This undoubted fact shouldn't be omitted as a key factor when deciding which public facility to fund primarily. \\n This phenomenon is also one of the main causes why museums suffer from lack of visitors, especially inhabitants of particular town. People tend to prefer facilities where they're able to calm down, either physically or mentally, and that's not what institutions like museums offer. \\n On the other hand, public gardens do this task very well. Yet, it is just one of their benefits among others. They also provide escape to the nature within reality of a town or city. And because they are not single purpose, one is able to choose from several activities, including sitting and observing the environment, laying under the sun, reading or having conversation. \\n Selection of preferred institution is definitely not an easy task. However, if necessary, we should put an emphasis on needs of today's life - and they're represented much better by public gardens, who are very often established as a central place of the particular area.","human_feedback_text":"Your whole essay is just a very long introduction. It does not give the reader any information that would explain why these two places deserve to have funding from the local authorities. In fact, you have not even properly discussed the indicated prompt. Was the question you were provided only a guideline? Were you supposed to write a different essay based on a personal prompt instead? That is what you did. You did not respond to the prompt at all with your essay. You responded to a question that you gave yourself in the first paragraph. Look at this: \\n Mid-Term Prompt: Which facilities should receive money from local authorities? \\n Your Title: A town dilemma: To favour history or fulfill present needs? \\n Your Prompt: should we stick to historical enlightenment or fulfill needs for piece of nature and place to rest? \\n The last 2 prompt references were the ones you created. It obviously does not have any relationship at all to the original prompt provided for your test. This is called a prompt deviation and often results in a failing score within any essay test. \\n Your total essay only creates an introductory statement. It does not discuss any aspect of the prompt in a proper manner. You should have directed the essay from the very beginning to discuss the original topic. For example: \\n <em>Local authorities have only a limited amount of money to spend on public facilities every year. Therefore, considerations as to which facilities should receive the funds are often discussed. It is my opinion that the gardens and museums should receive most of the funding. I will explain my reasons for advocating for this idea below.<\/em> \\n Then from there, your second paragraph should have been: \\n <em>Although they offer divergent ways of spending leisure time, both museums and public gardens occupy their important role within the town. Their funding should therefore be a priority for the local government.<\/em> \\n Build the reasoning portion of the paragraph from there. Your essay has potential but is not directed to discuss the essay prompt in a more relevant manner. That is where the problem of your essay lies. Due to the problem in the information presentation, it is useless to correct any grammar, style, or sentence structure mistakes. Once the content of the essay is inappropriate, then the whole essay fails to deliver the required elements and will eventually result in a failing score.","AI-augmented_feedback_text":"The essay, which poses the question of whether towns should prioritize funding for historical museums or for public gardens that cater to present-day needs, brings forth an interesting dilemma. The composition presents a good initial discussion of the topic, contrasting the role of museums with the benefits of public gardens, but it does miss some key elements that would strengthen its argument and align it better with the prompt provided.\n\nFirst, it's essential to ensure the essay directly addresses the question at hand. In this case, the essay diverged from the specific prompt about which facilities should be prioritized for funding by local authorities. The essay rather introduces a related, but distinct, question focusing on choosing between historical enlightenment (museums) and fulfilling the need for nature and rest (public gardens). This shift in focus results in what is known as prompt deviation, and it's crucial for the clarity and success of the essay to stick closely to the original question provided.\n\nSecond, the structure of the essay resembles an extended introduction rather than a fully developed argument. Each paragraph of an essay should ideally introduce a new point or perspective that supports your central thesis. A stronger approach would have been to introduce the dilemma as identified, followed by paragraphs that delve into why one option might be more deserving of funding than the other, based on the criteria of the original prompt. Going step-by-step through each facility's merits, with supportive examples or data, would make for a more compelling argument.\n\nRegarding grammar, spelling, and style, the writing is generally clear but could benefit from a more precise use of language and a careful review of grammatical structures. Some sentences could be simplified for clarity, making the essay more accessible to its readers. For instance, phrases like 'financial contribution for them would be supported by numerous statements' might be clearer if expressed more directly ('many arguments support funding for both').\n\nThe point of view is evident, leaning towards supporting public gardens as a response to today's needs. However, to solidify this viewpoint, explicit reasons why public gardens fulfill contemporary needs better than museums would add strength to the argument. Comparing the educational and cultural value of museums against the mental and physical health benefits provided by public gardens could be a way to offer a balanced perspective before stating a conclusion.\n\nTo enhance your next draft, consider these steps:\n1. Revisit the original prompt and align your essay's argument directly with it.\n2. Structure your essay so that each paragraph introduces and explores a distinct argument or perspective that supports your position.\n3. Review grammar and sentence constructions for clarity and correctness.\n4. Provide specific examples or evidence to support why your chosen facility (museums or public gardens) should be prioritized for funding.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, your essay will not only respond more directly to the prompt but will also present a clearer and more persuasive argument supported by a logical structure and clear language."}
